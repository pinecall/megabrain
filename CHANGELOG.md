# Changelog

## Unreleased — the registry gets its second backend, and its first caller

**`resolve()` shipped with no caller.** The chat registry existed, was tested, and every
production site constructed `OpenAICompatible` by name anyway — including `ask`'s
`_narrator`. So "adding a backend is an adapter plus an entry" was true of the registry and
false of the program. Routing `_narrator` through `resolve()` is what made the claim
executable; it also surfaced the reason nobody had: `resolve()` took no arguments, so
routing through it would have silently dropped whatever `megabrain.json` committed as its
narrator and used the built-in default instead. `resolve(model=…)` /
`default_providers(model)` carry it now.

**The Claude Agent SDK backend is ported** (`providers/chat/claude.py`, extra
`megabrain[claude]`) — the last of v2's providers that v3 had not brought over. It drives
the bundled Claude Code binary rather than an HTTP endpoint, so credentials are whatever
that install resolves; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or the Bedrock/Vertex variables the SDK
documents) says explicitly which account pays. The v2 note about needing
`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` is obsolete: the SDK bundles the binary.

**Opt-in, deliberately unlike v2.** v2 auto-preferred `claude` whenever the package was
importable. That means the machine that ran `pip install 'megabrain[claude]'` for an
unrelated reason starts narrating on a different lane, with different latency, and nothing
in the output says so — a measurement that moves because of an install is a measurement
nobody can reproduce. `MEGABRAIN_CHAT_PROVIDER=claude` and nothing else selects it.

**It narrates without opening files, and that is stated rather than hidden.** The SDK runs
its own tool loop, so there is no pending call to hand back to `converse` — this backend
returns text on the first pass, which is the fail-open the narrator already documents. The
walkthrough is written from what retrieval chose. Reporting a tool call the narrator could
never complete would have been the alternative, and it would have been a lie in the shape
of a feature.

**The async seam, which is where the design work went.** The SDK is async end to end and
this engine has no async twin — a hard rule with a test behind it. `asyncio.run` cannot
bridge them: it raises the moment a loop is already running in the calling thread, which is
exactly what happens when the HTTP transport narrates from inside a route. `_claude_sdk.py`
owns **one thread with one loop** for the process and submits work with
`run_coroutine_threadsafe`, which works either way, gives the sync side a real wall-clock
bound, and re-raises the coroutine's exception with its traceback. A timeout **cancels** the
future rather than abandoning it: a run left going holds its CLI subprocess open, so one
narration per timeout would leak one process per timeout.

Three smaller things the tests pinned, each one a way to be wrong quietly:

- **A namespaced model never reaches the CLI.** The project narrator default is
  `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, read from `megabrain.json` and meaningless to a binary
  that resolves its own names. Passed through, every narration would have failed on the
  model rather than on the mismatch — so a name with a slash falls back to `haiku`.
- **The whole-block fallback does not double-count.** Modern builds emit the deltas *and*
  the assembled message; counting both returns every answer twice. Older builds emit no
  `StreamEvent` at all, so dropping the fallback would return the empty string with nothing
  to say why. The guard is what makes both true at once.
- **An SDK failure surfaces as `ProviderError`.** Left raw it reached callers as some
  SDK-internal exception nothing catches by kind — and the lanes that fail open on a
  provider being down would not have.

Tested entirely offline with no `claude-agent-sdk` installed anywhere: the SDK is a
constructor-injected seam, the same shape as the HTTP transport, and the fake duck-types
the message classes by name exactly as the provider dispatches them.

**Then it was run against the real SDK, and the offline suite had missed three things** —
which is the lesson this repository already wrote down and had to learn again: a green
suite proves nothing about a module that talks to something external until a real
request/response pair has been read.

- **A refused run reported the word "success".** `claude-agent-sdk` 0.2.128 delivers a
  refusal as `ResultMessage(subtype='success', is_error=True, result='Credit balance is
  too low')` and then raises quoting the **subtype** — so the exception read
  `returned an error result: success` and the only actionable sentence in the exchange was
  discarded. `drain` checks `is_error` now (never the subtype: every healthy run also ends
  `subtype='success'`) and raises `the Claude CLI refused the run: <reason>`. The refusal
  also arrives as ordinary assistant text, so it is raised rather than returned —
  otherwise an outage is quoted back to the reader as if the model had narrated it.
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` silently beats the local Claude Code login.** With one exported
  the run bills that API account and never touches the login, so a depleted key fails
  every narration while a working login sits unused — behind a CLI warning that is easy to
  read past. Now documented in the README, ARCHITECTURE and the env-var table. The first
  draft of those docs said "set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be explicit about which account
  pays", which is actively the wrong advice for anyone narrating on their local login.
- **One test depended on the extra NOT being installed.** It passed on every clean machine
  and went red the moment the SDK was installed to run this very check — the "whose shell
  ran it" failure `hermetic_env` exists to prevent, one variable to the left. The absence
  is forced through `sys.modules` now.

**Measured end to end** on this repository, `haiku`, 24 candidates: 27 s total, first token
at 14 s, 48 streamed deltas, citations spliced verbatim. The HTTP lane stays the default.

**ONE switch now moves EVERY model lane.** Routing the narrator through `resolve()` had
left three lanes constructing their endpoint by name — `rerank`'s judge, `expand` (which
shares it) and the map labels — so `MEGABRAIN_CHAT_PROVIDER=claude` switched `ask` and
`grep --why` and quietly left the rest billing OpenRouter. Quietly is the operative word:
every one of those lanes is fail-open, so nothing ever said so. `judge_provider` and the
labels resolve through the registry now; `resolve(model=…, timeout=…)` carries each lane's
own tuning, so the judge keeps the model its measurements were taken on.

**And the judge's wall learned whose backend it is bounding.** First live run on the SDK
lane: `judge: None` on every call — `verdict_of` bounds each batch with
`future.result(timeout=30)`, a number measured on HTTP, and a CLI spawn eats ~14 s before
the first token. The lane failed open, silently, which is the worst way. The wall asks the
provider now (`wall_for`): a backend that carries a `timeout` knows its own cost, one that
does not gets the measured HTTP wall — and the router hands the lane `timeout` to the
endpoint only, never to the subprocess. Verified live on the subscription:
`judge: {kept: 5, of: 21}` at 47 s.

## Unreleased — a JS repository stops hiding its tests

**`megabrain_grep` was returning three rows on express and thirty on click, and
the reason was neither retrieval nor ranking.** Two independent bugs, both found
by measuring the same task in two languages, and both of them a Python bias that
had been sitting in the code looking like a heuristic.

**A mocha or jest file declared nothing.** A suite declares its units by CALLING
a function with a label and a closure, which tree-sitter reads as an expression
statement — so `test/res.attachment.js` was indexed with two symbols, both of
them `require` bindings, while the fifteen cases a reader actually edits were
unnameable. The literal lane resolves a match to the symbol CONTAINING it, so no
row could ever land inside a test file in a JS repository. `LangSpec` gained
`group_calls`/`case_calls`: an `it`/`test`/`beforeEach` block is a symbol with
its own line range, a `describe` is recursed into and never recorded (recording
it would swallow every case inside and hand back one row meaning "this file").
Express: **3.9 → 12.3 symbols per file**, and Python's 16.7 stops being a
different sport.

**A one-word identifier was not chased.** `identifiers()` demanded snake_case or
camelCase, which is how `add res.inline beside res.attachment` yielded only
`contentDisposition` — `attachment` is ten characters of one lowercase word, and
the index has it at `lib/response.js:606`. One-word names are the norm in JS and
Ruby and the exception in Python, so the shape rule was a preference for Python
wearing a heuristic's clothes. The repo's own symbol table decides now: it
declares `attachment` and has never heard of `beside`.

**Admitting one-word names then cost PRECISION in Python, which is the price of
the fix above and had to be paid back.** `Option` is a class click declares, so
the index vouches for it, and it resolves to 10 implementation sites — 10 rows of
noise (`str_to_bool`, `CompletionItem`, `test_string_option`) beside
`show_envvar`'s 3. But the one-word names that WERE the target resolve to one or
two: `attachment` 1, `inline` 1, express's `render` 5. Same admission, opposite
verdict, and the site count separates them — so a name the index vouched for gets
`MAX_BARE` (6) implementation sites where a name that is specific on its own
(`resolve_envvar_value`) keeps the wide budget. Click's render went from 27 rows
to 10, and the three in `core.py` are now exactly `Option.__init__` (the kwarg),
`get_help_extra` (the logic) and `OptionHelpExtra` (the TypedDict that gains a
key). Express and sinatra unchanged.

**`.gitignore` now decides what is not source, which was the other half of the
noise.** shipway compiles TypeScript into `bin/`, declared in its own
`.gitignore` under "# Build output" — and 122 of its 196 indexed files were that
output, so every `src/` symbol had a compiled twin and one site returned two
rows. The universal exclude list cannot fix this, on purpose: `bin/` holds real
code in a Python or Rust project, and baking one repo's layout into a global list
applies it everywhere. The repo had already answered.

Delegated to `git check-ignore` (one process for the whole candidate list, after
the in-memory excluder has cut `node_modules` for free) because gitignore has
negation, `**`, per-directory files and a global file — and a half-implementation
drops files nobody meant to drop. Writing the negation test proved the point: git
will NOT re-include a file whose parent DIRECTORY is excluded, so `bin/` plus
`!bin/keep.js` keeps it ignored, and a hand-rolled matcher would have indexed the
artifact.

Fails OPEN — no git, no repo, a timeout, an exit code other than 0 or 1 all yield
"nothing ignored". Losing the filter costs precision; losing the index costs the
tool. Every skip is recorded with reason `gitignored`, because a file that
vanishes without explanation is the hardest kind of bug to notice.

| repo | files indexed | dropped |
|---|---|---|
| shipway | 196 → **75** | `bin/*.js`, `bin/*.d.ts` |
| aldus-v2 | 338 → 284 | `dist-demo/`, `dist-lib-types/*.d.ts` |
| pinecall/sdk | 186 → 170 | `src.bkp/` — a dead snapshot competing with live code |
| express · click · sinatra | **unchanged** (146 · 120 · 162) | nothing |

It is a heuristic with one measured false positive, so it is opt-out per repo:
megabrain-v2 gitignores `evals/`, which IS source. `"gitignore": false` in
`megabrain.json` — a committed field rather than a flag, so whoever hits it
answers once for everyone who clones.

**And the row cap emptied instead of trimming, which the better extractor then
exposed.** With test cases contributing rows, three of five ordinary express
tasks went from a useful render to NOTHING: `sendFile` resolves to 47 sites —
three implementation and 44 test cases — and one cap over the union called the
task's most specific name "vocabulary". Now the quota is per name and per kind:
all of the implementation, `MAX_TESTS` of the suite, preferring the suite named
after the identifier, and a total that TRUNCATES with the most specific name
served first. The five tasks return 12–27 rows in 8–30 ms; three of them used to
return nothing.

**The fix reaches indexes you already have, for free.** A chunker that learns to
see a new declaration changes nothing for an indexed repository — the indexer
revisits a file only when its bytes change, so express kept answering 3.9 until
it was re-indexed. `EDGE_SCHEMA` had solved this for the graph; symbols now have
`SYMBOL_SCHEMA`, and because a symbol costs a parse and no embedding, a plain
`megabrain index` re-extracts them with **zero embedding calls**:

| repo | symbols | changed | time |
|---|---|---|---|
| pineward | 228 → 332 (**1.46x**) | 0 | 0.9 s |
| LumiCRM | 1 681 → 2 096 (1.25x) | 0 | 2.0 s |
| aldus-v2 | 1 602 → 2 001 (1.25x) | 0 | 1.4 s |
| vscode-js-debug | 3 792 → 4 319 (1.14x) | 5 | 1.4 s |
| pinecall | 5 047 → 5 521 (1.09x) | 0 | 20.2 s |

Scope, since the marker cannot enforce it: this rebuilds SYMBOLS, not chunks. A
change to where a file may be CUT still needs `--force`, because those rows carry
vectors that have to be bought again.

**Also removed: `megabrain_code` and `megabrain_replace`.** Measured across five
tasks in three languages and retired. What carried the value was the narrator
opening files until it had the whole flow, and that now belongs to `ask` itself;
the edit machinery around it — prepared batches, APPLY anchors — kept being
thrown away by the readers it was built for, and applying an edit is work the
host's editor already does. The surface is four tools: `ask`, `grep`, `search`,
`index`.

## 1.0.0 — megabrain grep: literal search that understands what it found

**New tool: `megabrain grep`** (CLI + `megabrain_grep` over MCP). grep gives
you lines; this gives you roles. Every match is resolved against the index
the engine already built and grouped into:

- **DEFINES** — the symbol's definition site
- **READS** — real code using it, ranked by graph centrality (the site more
  of the repo depends on outranks the leaf), each with its `← reached from`
  list: the files whose import/call edges land on it — the dependents grep
  cannot see
- **CONFIG/DATA · TESTS · DOCS** — structured, never dropped

One call answers "where is this defined, who reads it, who depends on the
reader" — the three greps you were about to run, already joined. And an
ABSENT caller is a finding: on nx#35656, the daemon not appearing in the
flag-reading file's reached-from list IS the bug. Zero LLM, no vectors
loaded — one pass over the indexed chunk text, ~50 ms on a 5,600-file repo.
Known limit, said out loud: it searches the indexed corpus, so a `.json`
preset the index skips won't match; section overflow is counted, never
silent.

This closes the standing routing rule "skip megabrain when you know the
exact string" — now the literal lane is also index-aware. The MCP
instructions route accordingly.

**The rerank and the narrator are now separate model knobs, each measured at
its own job.** They had shared one constant, which assumed the two jobs want
the same thing. They don't: narration reasons about a flow in prose, the rerank
emits a short id array under a 30K-char prompt.

- **rerank → `google/gemini-3.5-flash-lite`** (`providers.FAST_RERANK_MODEL`).
  20 mined merged-fix cases x 3 reps, identical candidate lists: recall and
  rank-1 tie with 3.1 (19/20 both, every rep), but 3.5 hands the agent **2
  files where 3.1 hands 3** — every rep, no exceptions. Less noise, same
  answers, ~1.13s.
- **narration stays `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`** (`FAST_CHAT_MODEL`).
  On rails#57197 — the state-race case 0.18.1 called a model-tier limit —
  both models now return the CORRECT verdict 3/3, so 3.1 wins on speed
  (~3.8s vs ~5.6s) and price. **That both now pass is the finding**: the
  narration failure was never the model's tier, it was what retrieval fed it.
  The recall floor, body-batched rerank and untruncated render fixed the
  narration by fixing its evidence.

Bigger is measurably WORSE at reranking: `gpt-5-nano` and `glm-4.7-flash`
return empty (reasoning spends the 300-token cap), `minimax-m2.7` truncates
the JSON array, `qwen3.5-flash` takes **49s** on one case (vs 1.2s), and
`gemini-3.5-flash` — 5x the price — failed open at 5.6s. The rerank wants an
obedient fast model, not a smart one.

**Recall floor: fusion is a ranking opinion, never a recall gate.** The
field report from the nx#35656 demo run scored search 7/10, and the one
structural complaint was measured to the row: the prior-art file the agent
most needed (`project-glob-changes.ts`, a 48-line helper inside another
feature's directory) sat at **raw-dense rank 13 of 10,891** — and file
fusion pushed it to 81, out of the bundle. The agent found it with plain
grep. Reusable logic lives under a different name in a different subsystem
*by construction*, so the ranking was structurally biased against exactly
the "don't duplicate logic" lookup where retrieval matters most. Now every
non-test file owning a raw-dense top-15 chunk is owed a bundle slot:
appended to the RELATED tail (`·via-floor`), same stance as the flow lane —
pure additions, never ranking, never displacing; `bundle_full` can only
rise. The first live test also caught a partial floor (capped at 4 adds, the
owed file was 5th) — a floor that drops the 5th owed file is not a floor, so
N itself is the only bound. Verified: the nx query now carries the helper in
the bundle and the prune signal list; a 4-test suite pins the burial, the
restore, pure additivity, and the test-file exclusion; the phase-6 golden
gate passes (two golds relabeled with dated notes — the eval repo evolved
after the 2026-03-11 labeling and grew files that answer two queries better
than their original golds; completeness was never lost).

**The pruned render now has an output budget (24K chars,
`MEGABRAIN_RENDER_BUDGET`).** Field case (click#3362 demo run, agent
self-score 6/10): one scoped question rendered 90KB deterministic / 60KB
post-rerank, overflowed the MCP host's inline limit, and the agent worked
from a 2KB preview — "one call hands you the code" is void if the host
truncates the answer. The budget spends bodies top-down by rank; past it,
a chunk renders as its span line + `Read file:Lx-y` pointer, and a single
body is line-capped at 80 with the remainder said out loud. Files are
NEVER dropped — completeness is chunk-list completeness — and the spec-test
tail always renders (it was invisible in the overflow). The field query now
renders 27KB with the answering chunks' full code inline.

**Two first-index-of-a-big-monorepo bugs fixed** — both found by pointing the
engine at nx (5,606 files) for the first time:

- **Token-cap 400s now bisect instead of killing the index.** The batcher's
  chars-per-token estimate is per-language wrong by construction: markdown
  tokenizes at ~2.8, dense TypeScript at 1.9 — and the 2.5 estimate shipped a
  131k-token batch against pplx-embed's 120k cap, aborting the whole index.
  The constant drops to the measured 1.9, and any provider "too many tokens"
  rejection now splits the batch in half and retries each side: a wrong
  estimate costs one extra round trip, never the index. A SINGLE text over
  the cap still fails loudly (that is a chunker-bounds violation), and
  non-token errors (auth, quota) never bisect.
- **`packages/` is no longer "vendored" in a JS workspace.** The scan census
  inherited Linguist's NuGet rule — in .NET, `packages/` holds restored
  dependencies — but in the JS ecosystem the same name is the universal
  first-party monorepo convention, and the census proposed skipping nx's
  entire 4,275-file source tree. A workspace manifest at the root
  (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `nx.json`, `lerna.json`, `turbo.json`,
  `rush.json`, or `package.json` `workspaces`) now marks `packages/` as
  code; without one, the NuGet behavior stands. nx census: 1,332 → 5,589
  files.

**Validated against 82 real merged fixes, 9 repos, 5 languages** (evals kept
in `evals/`, local by policy). Ground truth is never hand-made: each case's
query is the human-written bug description (PR title + body) and its gold set
is the non-test source files the merged fix actually touched.

- nx + rails (26 cases, mined from local history): gold in the bundle 24/26;
  rank median 1; after the live rerank the agent receives ~6 files of which
  ~73% share the gold file's subsystem. Both misses are semantically thin
  WIRING files (a locator, a `require` list) — the fix's neighborhood was
  returned correctly, the one-line connection file has nothing for an
  embedding to grip.
- pipecat / express / gin / click / requests / ky / sinatra (56 cases mined
  via the GitHub API, 2 live-rerank reps each = 112 measurements):
  deterministic signal list carried the gold **112/112**; rerank kept it
  106/112 with **zero** flip between reps; every survivor ranked **#1**;
  median 3 files handed to the agent, median 1 unrelated. All 6 drops trace
  to 3 mined cases that violate the eval's own premise — release/dep-bump
  PRs whose "query" is a changelog (gold `__version__.py`), where dropping
  the version file is the defensible judgment. On the 53 valid cases the
  rerank is 106/106.

The evals found more harness bugs than engine bugs (a merge commit's
`--name-only` hides the real diff; "non-gold = noise" is unfair when gold is
one file), which is the intended direction of travel.

Below, the two unpublished sections this release folds in.

## 0.18.8 (unreleased) — the rerank judge finally sees the code

The rerank model used to judge each candidate by a one-line card: id, file,
symbols, and the chunk's FIRST non-empty line — for a whole-file chunk, its
import statement. Field case (nx#35656): the question named
`analyzeSourceFiles`, the answering file read it at L36, the card showed
`import { ProjectGraphProjectNode } …` — and the judge dropped the one file
that answered the question.

What the judge should see was measured, not assumed — 6 ground-truth queries
across the nx (5,606 files), rails and megabrain indexes, 4 views, 3 reps:

| view | target kept | rank (med) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 query-aware line | 18/18 | 2 |
| 6-line window | 12/18 | – |
| full bodies, one call | 15/18 | 1 |
| **full bodies, batches of 8** | **18/18** | **1** |

Two findings drive the design. **Partial evidence is worse than little
evidence**: on the cross-subsystem query (rails#57197 — the answering file
never mentions the state the question asks about) the mid-size views dropped
the answer 3/3 while the 1-line and batched views kept it 3/3. And **one big
call is the worst of both worlds**: 29 candidates in a single 34K-token prompt
missed 3/18 targets that the same bodies split into 8-per-call batches all
kept — small pools stop the judge from confidently ruling files out.

So the rerank now sends **full chunk bodies in batches of 8, judged in
parallel** (`MEGABRAIN_RERANK_BATCH`), merged by per-batch position. On
flash-lite that is ~$0.009 and ~+300 ms per rerank. A local endpoint (Ollama
serializes; parallel 9K-token prompts choke it) and the claude CLI lane
(~18 s per spawned call) stay on the previous view, now query-aware: the
card's line is the one sharing the most identifier characters with the
question, not blindly the first. Fail-open is all-or-nothing across batches —
one failed batch returns the untouched deterministic result, never a partial
merge that silently drops a batch's worth of candidates.

Verified end-to-end on the production path: 18/18 targets kept, median rank
1.0, median 1.3 s per rerank.

## 0.18.7 (unreleased) — off the preview slug; 3.5-flash-lite measured and declined

`google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite` is now the OpenRouter default, replacing
`…-flash-lite-preview`. The stable slug exists, preview slugs get retired, and
a bakeoff found the two behave identically (rerank: 3/3 correct files in 3 runs
each, same latency). Nothing to do — an explicit `MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL` /
`MEGABRAIN_RERANK_MODEL` still wins.

**`gemini-3.5-flash-lite` was tested for the default and rejected.** The model
does two jobs here — it narrates `ask` and it is the rerank's fast lane — so it
was measured at both against the hardest case in the repo's history
(rails/rails#57197, a state-race bug):

| | rerank: core files found | narration | output price |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1-flash-lite | **3/3, 3/3, 3/3** | wrong verdict | $1.50/M |
| 3.5-flash-lite | 2/3, **3/3**, 2/3 | wrong verdict | $2.50/M |

3.5 dropped one of the three files a real fix touched in two of three runs.
Completeness beats ordering is the engine's second locked rule, so losing recall
to pay 67% more per output token is not a trade. Narration was a tie at *bad* —
both models assert the deferred enqueue sees the right value when it demonstrably
does not, which is a model-tier limit rather than a version one (see 0.18.1).
3.5 is marginally faster and more concise; that buys nothing here.

> **Both verdicts here were overturned in 1.0.0 — read that section, not this
> one.** Neither was wrong when measured; both measured a system that no longer
> exists. The rerank judged 1-line hint cards then and full chunk bodies now
> (3.5 wins on the new task). And the narration failure was never a model-tier
> limit: with 1.0.0's retrieval feeding it, *both* models now call rails#57197
> correctly, 3/3. Quality attributed to the model belonged to what reached it.

The two provider tests that hardcoded the slug now assert against
`providers.FAST_CHAT_MODEL`, so the next model bump changes one constant instead
of failing tests that were pinning the routing, not the string.

## 0.18.6 — a cached answer costs no LLM call, so it costs no rate-limit slot

Two fixes for a public demo, both from watching one get used.

**The rate limiter charged for cache hits.** `--rate-limit N` exists to bound
LLM spend, but the flow cache serves a matching question with zero LLM calls —
and a visitor re-asking a popular question was still burning quota on answers
that cost nothing to serve. Whether a request will hit the cache is only known
after retrieval runs, so the slot is still taken up front and now handed back:
`RateLimiter.refund(ip)` on `served_from_cache` (buffered `/ask`) and on the
`cached` SSE event (`/ask/stream`). A visitor who only asks cached questions
can now go forever.

**The spec tests were invisible.** 0.18.4 appended dropped test files as a
compact "tests pinning this behavior" section, and after a few hundred lines of
code bodies nobody reads two lines at the bottom — the person who asked for the
feature looked at an output containing it and asked where the tests were. The
header now announces them (`⚠ 2 spec test(s) at the BOTTOM`), which is the one
line every reader does see.

## 0.18.5 — the MCP server finally introduces itself, and `scope_path` says what it costs

**The server shipped no `instructions` at all.** `initialize` returned protocol,
capabilities and serverInfo — nothing telling the calling agent what megabrain
is or when to reach for it. That matters more than it sounds: with tool search
enabled (Claude Code's default) the tool SCHEMAS stay deferred and the agent
sees only tool NAMES until it searches for them, so the server instructions are
the one megabrain text an agent is guaranteed to read.

There is one now (~450 tokens, once per session): what megabrain is (a
pre-built index, retrieval with no LLM, verbatim code), when to skip it (you
already know the literal string — grep is faster), and the routing between the
six tools — `search` for the exact code to read and the default for a
reproducible bug, `ask` for a narrated cross-subsystem flow, `graph` to open an
unfamiliar repo, plus `index`/`flows`/`forge`. It ends with the two lessons
that decide answer quality, both from real sessions: `scope_path` excludes, and
on a bug you name the state to track rather than the symptom. Tests pin that
every tool is mentioned, that both lessons survive edits, and that the
handshake actually ships the field.



An agent scoped a search to `activejob/lib/active_job` — the natural way to
"search the implementation" — and the 0.18.4 tests section came back empty.
Correctly so: scoping excludes everything outside the folder from retrieval
BEFORE scoring, `activejob/test/` included, so there was no test left to
surface. The tool never said that; the parameter read like a harmless focus
knob.

The first attempt at a fix was engine machinery (a name-convention companion-
tests lane with monorepo disambiguation) and it was rightly rejected as a
hack: the input was wrong because the tool description withheld the one fact
the caller needed. Reverted before release.

What shipped instead is the fact, where the LLM reads it: `scope_path` on
`megabrain_search` and `megabrain_ask` now states that scoping EXCLUDES
everything outside the folder — tests included, which are often the spec of
the behavior — and says to scope to the package root (`activejob`), never to
its `lib/`/`src/` subfolder. Verified over MCP stdio: scoped to `activejob`,
the same query returns the signal files plus
`enqueue_after_transaction_commit_test.rb` in the tests section.

## 0.18.4 — a dropped test is not noise: it is often the spec

Field case, same rails#57197 session: the rerank pruned
`enqueue_after_transaction_commit_test.rb` — and that file was the decisive
one. It pins instance identity (`successfully_enqueued?` must flip on the SAME
object after commit; `around_enqueue` runs on it), which is exactly what ruled
out the issue author's proposed dup-based fix. The agent recovered it with a
separate grep; megabrain never showed it.

Dropping tests from the signal list is deliberate and stays: tests crowd
implementation by shared vocabulary (the `TestPenaltyLane` exists because a
test sometimes out-scores the core file it tests). What changes is what
"dropped" means — structure, not deletion, the same stance as the CORE/RELATED
map:

- `llm_rerank` now splits dropped chunks: test files land in `res["tests"]`,
  everything else in `noise`.
- `render_pruned` (CLI + MCP `megabrain_search`) appends a compact
  "— tests pinning this behavior (read before changing it)" section: id, file,
  lines, symbols — no bodies, so it costs a few lines, not a screen.
- A test the model deliberately KEEPS stays in the signal list; the section is
  only for the ones it removed.

On the field query, the tail's first entry is now that exact test file,
listing `FakeActiveRecord` and the identity-pinning job classes. The signal
list above it is unchanged: the three implementation files the fix touched,
bug file first.

## 0.18.3 — the rerank takes the fast lane: 18s → 0.8s for Claude Code users

A field report rated `megabrain_search` 5/10 on a real bug hunt. Reproducing it
(13 configurations: three query phrasings × scoped/unscoped × two rerank
models, against a pristine rails checkout) split the complaints into
confirmed and not:

- **Confirmed: the rerank took ~18 seconds** from an MCP server on the claude
  provider — every `chat_text` there spawns the Claude CLI, for what is a
  mechanical 300-token id filter. The same filter on the OpenAI-compat lane
  takes ~0.7s with identical selections (both kept the bug file, both dropped
  the noise, 3/3 queries). `llm_rerank` now takes the fastest lane available:
  on the claude provider with an OpenRouter key (or a local endpoint) it
  routes the filter through that lane with `FAST_CHAT_MODEL`; an explicit
  `MEGABRAIN_RERANK_MODEL` pin keeps provider routing, and with no fast lane
  the claude provider remains the slow-but-working fallback. Measured after
  the fix, provider=claude: 814ms, and the selection was exactly the three
  files the fix touched — the bug file first.
  Two traps found on the way, both now pinned by tests: the fast lane must
  resolve its own key (`find_chat_key()` returns the "claude" sentinel and the
  request goes out uncredentialed — openrouter 401), and in environments where
  the claude spawn fails the old path failed OPEN silently, so users got the
  deterministic list believing the LLM had cleaned it.
- **Not reproduced: the claimed complete miss of the bug file.** In all 13
  configurations `exceptions.rb` was present at every stage — ranked #2 by the
  same haiku rerank the reporter used. Without the verbatim query it stays
  unexplained; the honest note is in the dev skill, not a speculative fix.
- **Real but not a bug: subscriber files are vocabulary magnets.** They
  instrument the exact events (`enqueue_retry`) that bug queries name, so the
  deterministic prune keeps them — that is what the LLM rerank lane is FOR,
  and after this fix it actually runs for Claude Code users and drops them.

## 0.18.2 — `ask` pointed at a command that doesn't exist

Every `ask` answer ended with `— full bundle: megabrain query`. There is no
`query` subcommand — it's `index/scan/search/ask/get/graph/chunks/studio/…`.
The verb was renamed at some point and the footer never followed, so the one
line telling you how to see everything `ask` left out has been sending people
to a usage error. It now points at `megabrain search`, which is what actually
prints the bundle. (Found by an agent that tried to follow the hint.)

Documented alongside it, from the same session's measurements:

- **For a reproducible bug, `search --prune --rerank` beats `ask`.** On
  rails/rails#57197 the rerank cut 33 chunks to the exact 3 files the fix
  touched in ~760ms and one cheap LLM call, against ~9.5s and a fan-out for
  `ask`. Both find the right code; only `ask` wraps it in prose, and prose is
  the surface that can be wrong. When two spans collide, putting them side by
  side *is* the explanation.
- **The CLI and MCP defaults differ, on purpose.** `megabrain_search` over MCP
  is always pruned and reranks by default, so an agent gets the good behavior
  for free; on the CLI both stay opt-in flags, because plain `megabrain search`
  is the zero-LLM, zero-cost path the docs promise and defaulting rerank on
  would silently bill every search. GUIDE.md now says so instead of leaving
  the divergence to be discovered.

## 0.18.1 — the narration must never contradict the code it cites

A coding agent using `megabrain_ask` on a real Rails bug (rails/rails#57197)
reported the failure that matters most for trust: retrieval was perfect — the
two colliding functions, side by side, in one call — but the prose *narration*
described the code's intent as its behavior ("the job instance holds its
scheduled_at until the transaction completes"). The code it cited showed the
opposite. An agent that trusted the summary instead of reading the spans would
have concluded there was no bug.

What a 12-cell experiment (3 prompt variants × 2 question shapes × 2 narrator
models, flow cache cleared per run) established:

- **No prompt variant fixes a weak narrator** on closure-over-mutated-state
  bugs: haiku and flash-lite verdicts stayed wrong under every variant, each
  run inventing a different plausible mechanism. A "never claim code
  ensures/preserves X" rule scored worst of all — it flipped one correct
  verdict — and was reverted.
- **Question shape dominates.** Symptom-framed questions ("why is the retry
  enqueued immediately?") misled every model, weak or strong; naming the state
  to track ("where along that path could `scheduled_at` be lost?") got the
  correct trace from the good ones (sonnet cleanly, qwen3-coder nearly).

What shipped, honestly scoped:

- Two grounding rules in the narrator prompt (all three surfaces — single
  agent, sub-agents, synthesis — share `_RULES`): trace ACTUAL runtime
  behavior in execution order, never presenting a name/docstring/intent as
  behavior; and when the query reports a bug, treat the report as fact and
  walk the order until the trace explains it — or say the cause isn't in the
  retrieved code. Principled spec of intended behavior; measured effect on
  weak narrators is neutral, not curative.
- The `megabrain_ask` MCP description no longer oversells: the spliced CODE is
  verbatim and unhallucinatable, and it now says the surrounding prose is LLM
  narration whose claims should be verified against that code — the exact
  discipline that saved the reporting agent.
- GUIDE.md documents the measured question-shape rule: follow the symptom with
  the variable, and you get the trace instead of a theory.
- The A/B methodology traps (the flow cache silently serving the control run,
  regex-grading of prose) are locked into the dev skill so the next tuning
  round doesn't rediscover them.

## 0.18.0 — cold-indexing a large repo drops from ~20 minutes to under one

Indexing rails-sized repos took ~20 minutes, and the time was pure HTTP
latency, not embedding work: the indexer embedded **per file**, so a file's
handful of chunks went out as one under-filled request and its skeleton as a
second request of ONE text — ~2× requests per changed file, all sequential.
A real A/B on the same 55-file corpus (fresh cache, live endpoint): **110
requests / 28.5 s before, 4 requests / 0.9 s after — 31× faster**, byte-same
inputs (identical text list, token count, and cost on both sides).

Two independent changes multiply:

- **Global batching.** `_index_into` now runs in three phases: chunk every
  changed file (pure CPU), embed **all** texts — chunks and skeletons — in one
  `embed()` call whose batches actually fill, then write per file. Same single
  transaction as always, with a stronger property for free: an embed failure
  now aborts *before* any row of the pass is written, so a provider outage can
  never leave a half-indexed store.
- **Concurrent requests.** `Embedder.embed()` fans missing batches over
  `MEGABRAIN_EMBED_CONCURRENCY` parallel workers (default 8). A local endpoint
  (Ollama/LM Studio) defaults to 1 — one GPU serializes anyway and parallel
  load can choke it. Rows always land by input index, usage accounting is
  lock-protected, cache tmp-files carry the thread id so two concurrent
  `embed()` calls racing on the same text can't collide, and any failed batch
  aborts the whole call — a partial result would silently index a repo with
  holes. A *cache* write is the one thing allowed to fail: POSIX `rename()`
  onto an existing path always wins, but Windows refuses it while another
  thread holds the destination open — reachable now that one `embed()` call
  can contain the same text twice. Same text means the same entry, so a
  refused write drops its temp file and moves on instead of killing the index.

Nothing about *what* is embedded changed: same texts, same vectors, same
store schema, sha-skip incremental untouched, query path untouched. The
studio's index SSE additionally gets `{"type": "embed", done, total}` progress
events so the long embed phase is no longer a silent gap after the file ticks.

### studio picked a repo that looked random, and the banner undersold itself

Running `megabrain studio` one directory inside an indexed repo booted a
*different* repo — reported as `repo=bernardocastro.dev` from a cwd that had
nothing to do with it. Two causes, both fixed:

- **The cwd check didn't walk up.** It tested `<cwd>/.megabrain` verbatim, so
  one directory down the repo went undetected and studio fell through to "the
  newest registry entry" — which then *looked* like it had picked the ancestor,
  when landing there was coincidence. It now resolves through `resolve_root()`,
  the same nearest-indexed-ancestor rule `ask`/`query`/`get`/`chunks` already
  use. An indexed cwd still outranks the registry.
- **The banner named one repo while serving ten.** `repo=X chunks=N` read as
  "X is the only repo loaded", and `N` counts only X — the registry preload had
  already loaded every repo into the rail. It now reads
  `repos=10 (registry) default=X chunks=N`, saying both how many are served and
  which one answers a request that omits `?repo=`. The branch that would have
  reported the count was unreachable: it required `boot is None`, which only
  happens when the registry is empty, in which case the `n == 0` branch fires
  first.

Note the default repo is sticky by design: it is the newest-indexed registry
entry, and the boot repo gets auto-refreshed on the first ask (60s TTL), which
bumps its `last_index`. Pass a path explicitly to pin a different one.

## 0.17.3 — indexing a docs-heavy repo died with `KeyError: 'data'`

Adding FastAPI to a demo whose seven repos are all small files broke the index
run on the first batch, with a traceback that named nothing useful:

```
File "megabrain/providers/embeddings.py", line 86, in _request
  for r in sorted(d["data"], key=lambda r: r["index"]):
KeyError: 'data'
```

**Requests are capped by TOTAL tokens, not by item count.** `pplx-embed`
rejects a request over 120k tokens across the whole batch. The embedder
batched by a fixed count (64), so 64 large markdown chunks asked for 252,064
tokens and the request was refused before a single vector came back. Batching
is now bounded by both the item count and a token budget
(`MEGABRAIN_EMBED_MAX_TOKENS`, default 100k, estimated at a deliberately
pessimistic 2.5 chars/token — the failing request measured 2.83). A text over
budget on its own is still sent alone rather than skipped: failing loudly beats
silently dropping content from an index.

Repos of small files never came near the cap, which is why this survived seven
repos and surfaced only when a docs-heavy one was added.

**The provider's message was being thrown away.** OpenRouter reports upstream
failures as HTTP 200 carrying an `{"error": {...}}` envelope, so `urlopen`
never raises and `post_json` returned the error body as if it were a result.
Every caller then indexed into a key that wasn't there. `post_json` now raises
`ProviderError` with the provider's own message, and retries the envelope when
the wrapped code is retryable — a 429 inside a 200 is still a 429. The
diagnosis above took three round trips against production precisely because
this message was discarded; it now appears in the traceback.

## 0.17.2 — one cited markdown doc broke every answer after it

Asked in `--docs` mode, the studio rendered the walkthrough inside out: the
prose of a cited `README.md` came out as a code block, the Ruby inside it came
out as paragraphs, and everything below stayed inverted to the end of the
answer. Four defects in a row, three of them ours by construction.

**The fence was fixed-width (`ask/narrator.py`).** `_code_block` always wrapped
the citation in exactly three backticks. A cited markdown doc carries its OWN
```lang fences, so the first inner one closed the block: the markdown leaving
the splicer was already invalid — for the CLI, the flow cache and anyone
reading a cached answer, not just the studio. The fence now sizes to its
content (`max(3, longest_backtick_run + 1)`), which is CommonMark's own rule
for nesting fenced code.

**The studio's parser could not have recovered anyway.** `md()` split on
`/```/` and alternated code/prose by parity, so every fence was a toggle and
one stray run inverted the rest of the answer. It now scans line by line: a run
of N backticks opens a block that only a line of N-or-more backticks closes.

**Headings ate the paragraph under them.** `inlineMd` wrapped a whole
blank-line-delimited block in `<h2>` when it started with `##`, so a heading
followed by prose on the next line swallowed the prose — the reason answers
showed a three-line `<h2>` and no body.

**The syntax highlighter ran over prose.** Markdown chunks reached `hl()`,
where the apostrophe in "the request's Accept header" opened a string span that
swallowed everything after it. Code goes to the scanner; `markdown`/`text` is
escaped as-is.

Answers cached as flows before this release still hold the old fences. The new
parser contains the damage to that one block instead of inverting the answer,
but they render correctly only once re-cached.

## 0.17.1 — the "code AND docs" mode never returned any code

**Removed: `ask --with-docs` / MCP `include_docs` / HTTP `include_docs`.** Not
deprecated — gone. A CLI script passing `--with-docs` now fails on the argument;
an MCP or HTTP caller passing `include_docs` has it ignored and gets the
code-only walkthrough.

It did not do what it named. The flag worked by leaving BOTH content filters
off, which is exactly the configuration 0.17.0 removed everywhere else: with
code and prose in one ranking, the prose wins. Asked on sinatra, the "code and
docs" mode returned a bundle whose CORE was `[README.md]` — the implementation
never made it in at all:

```
ask (default, code-only)     CORE: ['lib/sinatra/base.rb']
ask --docs                   CORE: ['README.md']
ask --with-docs (the blend)  CORE: ['README.md']      ← no code
```

Answering from both sides needs two lanes merged (top-N code + top-N docs), not
one blended ranking where they compete for the same slots. That is a different
feature, not a flag, so the broken one is out rather than left lying. The two
surviving modes now **partition** the bundle — every candidate belongs to
exactly one, asserted in `tests/test_ask_modes.py`.

## 0.17.0 — search is code OR docs, and the studio can search the docs

Two halves of one idea: make the docs a first-class thing to search, and stop
them from quietly competing with the code when you didn't ask for them.

### search is code OR docs, never a blend

**Breaking (search only):** `search` / `search --prune` / `megabrain_search` /
`GET /prune` / `POST /search` now rank the **code** and drop markdown before
scoring, the way `ask` always has. `--docs` / `docs: true` flips the whole bundle
to the markdown. Previously a plain `search` blended both.

Why it isn't a neutral default: the moment a repo indexes both, a large README
wins prose-shaped questions and buries the implementation it describes. Measured
on sinatra the day its docs were indexed — `README.md` took CORE (and 5 of the
top 6 pruned chunks) from `lib/sinatra/base.rb` for *"how are routes defined and
dispatched?"*. `ask` was already immune; `search` wasn't.

The policy now lives in exactly one function, `app.content_filters()`, which every
surface calls — the retrieval primitives stay neutral (`exclude_docs` /
`only_docs` both default off), so CLI, MCP, HTTP and the studio can't drift.
`ask --with-docs` remained as the one deliberate blend — and was removed in
0.17.1 once measured, because it returned no code.

Golden gate held across the change: R@1 **0.86**, bundle_full **1.00**, byte-for-byte
the same numbers under both defaults (no gold file in the set is markdown, so the
filter can't drop one).

### the docs became searchable

`ask --docs` existed but only filtered the CANDIDATE list: retrieval still ranked
code and docs together, so a docs walkthrough on a code-heavy repo was capped at
however many markdown files happened to outrank the code — sometimes one or two.
And `search` had no docs mode at all.

- **The docs/code split now happens at RETRIEVAL**, before scoring
  (`scoring.filter_doc_chunks`, the generalization of the old
  `exclude_doc_chunks`). The whole bundle — CORE, RELATED, graph neighbors —
  stays on one side of the line. Fail-open both ways: docs asked of a repo with
  no markdown, or code asked of a docs-only repo, returns the unfiltered set
  rather than nothing.
- **New `--docs` on `search`** (bundle, `--prune` and multi-repo alike),
  **`docs` on `megabrain_search`** over MCP, **`?docs=1` on `GET /prune`** and
  **`docs` on `POST /search`**.
- **Studio: a "Docs only" toggle on both the Ask and the Search bar** — the same
  switch, one shared control so the tabs can't drift. Sticky across reloads.
  Flipping it re-runs Search (retrieval is local and free) but only repaints Ask,
  since an automatic re-ask would spend an LLM call and a rate-limit slot.
- **The docs lane can no longer lie about having run.** The filter fails open by
  design (a repo with no markdown gets code, not an empty answer) — which meant
  a toggle reading "Docs only on" over a screen of Ruby. Now `/repos` reports
  each repo's indexed-doc count, the studio disables the control at 0 with the
  reason ("No docs indexed"), `docsOn()` gates every request so a sticky "on"
  can't leak in from another repo, and `GET /prune?docs=1` returns
  `only_docs`/`docs_indexed` so the results carry a warning even if that count
  went stale. Found on the demo's sinatra checkout: 12 `.md` on disk, 0 indexed
  — its `.megabrainignore` excludes `*.md`.
- **Fixed: the studio's LLM-rerank toggle never restored its persisted state** —
  it was stored under `st.pruneRerank` and read as `st.rerank`, so it silently
  started off on every load.

## 0.16.0 — a cached answer must COVER the question, not just resemble it

Reported on the demo's sinatra repo. Both halves of this were cached
separately:

> How do before and after filters run around a handler, **and how is a route
> defined?**

and it was served the filters walkthrough alone, in 13 ms with no LLM —
silently dropping the routing half. The compound question CONTAINS a cached
one almost word for word, so it scored ~1.0 against it and sailed past
`FLOW_SERVE_SIM`.

The flaw is that cosine is **symmetric** while "may I reuse this answer?" is
not. Serving now also requires an asymmetric check (`flows.covers`, no LLM):
nearly every content word of the QUERY must already appear in the cached
question. New content words — here "route" and "defined" — mean the caller
asked for more than the cache holds, so the flow attaches as context and the
narrator answers the whole question fresh.

A genuine re-ask, a light rewording, and a query NARROWER than the cached one
all still serve instantly; question scaffolding ("how does…", "where is…")
never decides it.

## 0.15.3 — `done` really does terminate every path

Verifying 0.15.2 against the live demo turned up the last hole of the same
family: **the serve-from-cache path never emitted `done` either**. The stream
carried one `cached` event and stopped. The studio hid it by fabricating the
event client-side, so a cached answer looked fine there while a CLI or any
third-party consumer waiting on the documented terminator simply hung.

`done` now fires on every terminating branch — narrated, ungrounded fail-open
and served-from-cache — carrying `cached: true` and the stored answer's span
and file counts so the footer reports real numbers instead of zeros.

## 0.15.2 — a cached flow taught the narrator to fake its citations

Reported from the demo: a question matching TWO cached flows answered with
eight citation headers — file, line range, symbol — and **not one line of
code**, then streamed forever with no footer. Three bugs stacked into that:

- **The flow context leaked ask's citation chrome.** A stored flow is the
  RENDERED answer, so it carries the headers `_code_block` writes around each
  block (`` **`src/x.py` L58-83** — sym ``) plus `*(see … above)*`
  back-references. `strip_code` removed fenced code and `[[k]]` citations but
  not those, so the narrator was handed a worked example of the OUTPUT format
  and imitated it — emitting headers instead of `[[k]]`. The splicer then had
  nothing to replace, and the answer *looked* grounded while showing nothing.
  This is the anti-hallucination guarantee inverted: real file names and line
  numbers, no code behind them. `strip_code` now removes both shapes.
- **The fail-open path never emitted `done`.** An answer that cites nothing
  falls open to the full bundle, but that branch returned without the event
  every sink treats as end-of-stream — so the studio sat on
  "SYNTHESIS · STREAMING" indefinitely, no footer, on every ungrounded
  answer. It now emits `done` with `grounded: false`.
- **The studio hid the fallback.** The bundle was rendered only as an `else`
  to the synthesis, so whenever prose had streamed the fail-open bundle the
  engine had already computed stayed invisible and the reader had no way to
  tell the walkthrough was ungrounded. Both now render, with the reason.

## 0.15.1 — modern TypeScript had no graph either

Reported on the demo: ky drew nothing. Its 52 files produced **zero** edges,
and the cause was general enough to hit most current TS codebases.

- **`./x.js` now resolves to `x.ts`.** TypeScript ESM requires importing the
  COMPILED specifier — `from './core/Ky.js'` when the file on disk is
  `core/Ky.ts` — under `moduleResolution: node16/nodenext`. `ts_edges` only
  ever appended extensions, so it looked for `Ky.js.ts`, `Ky.js.js`, … and
  found nothing. Every relative import in such a repo was silently dropped.
  The resolver now rewrites `.js→.ts/.tsx/.d.ts`, `.mjs→.mts`, `.cjs→.cts`
  before the older candidates, so extensionless specifiers, directory
  `index` files and genuine `.js` files keep resolving exactly as before.
  ky: 0 → 125 edges, god nodes `source/index.ts` and `source/core/Ky.ts`.
- **`ts_edges` had no tests at all** — which is precisely how this shipped
  looking correct. It now has four, covering the ESM rewrite, the shapes
  that must NOT regress, bare/unresolvable specifiers, and parent traversal.
- `EDGE_SCHEMA` 3: existing indexes re-graph themselves on the next ordinary
  `index`, no re-embedding (ky regraphed 52 files for $0). The mechanism
  added in 0.15.0 paying for itself one release later.

## 0.15.0 — Ruby and Go join the graph

Ruby and Go repos indexed fine but drew an EMPTY graph: their strategies had
no edge extractor, so every file was an island — sinatra showed 2-file
communities and `base.rb → indifferent_hash.rb` reported "no route", gin had
no paths at all (reported live from the bernardocastro.dev demo).

- **Ruby require graph** (`ruby_edges`): `require_relative` resolves exactly
  against the file; `require`/`autoload` resolve through load-path candidates
  — repo-root `lib/<spec>.rb`, the bare path, the requiring file's own dir
  (test suites put it on `$LOAD_PATH` for `require 'test_helper'`), then any
  sub-gem's `*/lib/<spec>.rb` (sinatra ships rack-protection + contrib in
  one repo). `autoload :Const, 'path'` counts — it loads through the same
  path, and it's how rack-protection wires every strategy. Unresolved =
  stdlib/gem = no edge.
- **Go two-lane graph** (`go_edges` + `go_package_index`): the prepass maps
  each package's TOP-LEVEL decl names to their defining file (exact — Go
  enforces uniqueness; methods deliberately excluded, they're only reachable
  through a receiver). Import lane: in-repo import paths resolve by
  dir-suffix (go.mod isn't indexed, so the module prefix is stripped by
  trial), the module ROOT by package name for dotted module paths; each
  `alias.Name` use then pins the edge to Name's defining file. Package lane:
  files of one package call siblings with no import — a bare use of a
  sibling's top-level name is a `call` edge, scanned over comment/string-
  stripped source with a `(?<![.\w])` guard so `other.Name` never leaks in.
- Wired as `RubyStrategy`/`GoStrategy` subclassing `TreeSitterStrategy`
  (the registry's OCP point — the indexer is untouched). Measured on the
  demo repos: sinatra 0 → 53 struct edges (5 real communities, the path
  above now resolves), gin 0 → 296 (god nodes: `context.go`, `gin.go`,
  `routergroup.go`, `binding/binding.go` — exactly the core).
- **Existing indexes heal themselves** (`EDGE_SCHEMA`): edges only ever
  re-extracted for sha-changed files, so a repo indexed by an older engine
  kept its old — or, for Ruby/Go, EMPTY — graph forever, and the only cure
  was `--force`, which re-embeds every file for real money. The schema
  version now lives in the index; when it moves, the next ordinary `index`
  re-extracts edges for untouched files and touches no embeddings. Measured
  on the demo repos: sinatra 0 → 53 edges in 0.08 s for $0. Any future
  extractor improvement reaches old indexes the same way — bump the constant.
  `index` reports it as `regraphed`.
- **Community labels no longer vanish wholesale.** The naming call had a flat
  500-token output cap; express's 75 communities landed on *exactly* 500, so
  a repo with a few more truncated the JSON — and the parser demanded a
  closing brace, so one truncation cost EVERY label and the graph read
  "Community 0…74". The budget now scales per community
  (`LABEL_TOKENS_PER_COMMUNITY`), and the parser salvages whatever
  `"id": "label"` pairs arrived, so a cut reply loses only its tail. A reply
  with nothing usable is no longer cached either — the next view retries
  instead of serving the fallback from meta forever.

## 0.14.0 — the studio on a phone

The UI had no media queries at all: a fixed 248px rail ate two thirds of a
375px screen, every side-by-side layout stayed side-by-side, and the slide-
overs left a dead strip. One breakpoint at 860px:

- **The rail becomes an off-canvas drawer** behind a hamburger, with a scrim.
  It closes on repo pick (its whole job), scrim tap, tab change, or Escape.
- **Side-by-side layouts stack**: Search's signal|noise becomes one column,
  Graph puts the canvas above its panel.
- **Slide-overs go full-screen** (code navigator, settings) — `min(1060px,
  82vw)` left an unusable strip on a phone. The navigator's symbol rail is
  hidden there; it costs more width than it returns.
- **The topbar keeps only what you navigate with.** The model chip (dot +
  provider + model + chevron) could not share a 375px row with four tabs —
  it overlapped the Graph tab — so it moves into the drawer footer.
- `dvh` instead of `vh` (mobile `100vh` is the address-bar-hidden viewport,
  so the app's bottom sat under the browser chrome), 16px query input (iOS
  zooms anything smaller on focus), full-width tabs for ~44px touch targets,
  and `@media (hover:none)` drops hover states that stick after a tap.

Several of these layouts were inline styles, which a media query cannot
override — they are now classes (`.split-2`, `.graph-layout`, `.graph-canvas`,
`.graph-panel`, `.viewer-syms`).

## 0.13.1 — derived questions that read like questions

Measured against the demo box's real repos, 0.13.0's derived tier produced
garbage on every language WITHOUT a module docstring — the skeleton's first
line is already a declaration there, and it was being used as prose:

    How does const ( work end to end?                       (ky)
    How does var _ context.Context = (*Context)(nil) …?     (gin)
    How does func TestRenderJSON(t *testing.T) …?           (gin)

- **A declaration is no longer mistaken for a docline.** Go/TS/Rust files
  fall straight to naming the file by its dominant definition instead.
- **Symbol kinds cover every language.** `type` (Go structs, TS aliases) and
  `interface` were missing from the nameable set, so those languages fell
  through to their constants.
- **The DOMINANT definition names the file, not the first one.** Files open
  with small private helpers (`logerror`, `dict_to_sequence`) — the widest
  span is what the file is about (`Engine`, `Ky`, `Session`, `Context`).
- **Same-package test and generated files are excluded.** Go/JS keep tests
  beside the code (`x_test.go`, `x.test.ts`) and a directory-only filter
  missed them; `.pb.go`/`_pb2.py` generated code is out too.
- **Labels no longer collide.** Every sinatra file's widest symbol is the
  enclosing `Sinatra` module, so dedupe collapsed the whole repo to ONE
  question; each file now takes the best name no earlier file claimed.
- A docline that is a sentence ("click is a simple Python module inspired
  by…") is cut at the copula, so the label is the subject ("click").

## 0.13.0 — every repo gets starter questions

- **`GET /queries` now answers for EVERY indexed repo**, in three tiers, so
  the studio's Ask tab is never a blank box:
  1. `file` — the repo committed a `.megabrainqueries` (authored intent wins).
  2. `flows` — the questions already in the flow cache. The best fallback by
     far: each one's answer is *cached*, so clicking the chip serves
     instantly with no LLM and no rate-limit cost. The UI labels the row
     "⚡ ALREADY ANSWERED · instant, from cache".
  3. `derived` — deterministic, no-LLM questions over the repo's central
     files (`ask.warmup.derive_questions`).
  The response carries `source` so the UI can say honestly where the chips
  came from. Previously only tier 1 existed: a repo without the file got
  nothing.
- **Central-file ranking is language-agnostic.** It was edge degree alone,
  but the import/call graph only covers py/ts/js/php — measured on the demo
  box, ky has **0** edges, sinatra 1, gin 9, so degree-only ranking
  degenerated to arbitrary order on exactly the repos that need help. Ranking
  is now degree *plus symbol density*, and tests/examples/vendored paths are
  excluded from seeding a question.
- **`flows --warm` reuses `.megabrainqueries` when present** instead of
  paying an LLM planner call to guess. Writing the file once now both
  documents the repo's main workflows AND pre-caches exactly the answers the
  studio offers as chips — so every chip serves instantly afterwards.
- The studio hides "Warm all" on a `--readonly` box: one click would burn N
  LLM asks of the host's budget and the visitor's whole rate-limit window.

## 0.12.1 — studio: Ask opens first · clean repo switches

- **Ask is the first tab and the default view.** It's the star of the studio;
  it opened on Search only for historical reasons.
- **Switching repos no longer leaves a stale query behind.** The results were
  cleared but the input kept the previous repo's question, which read as a
  pending request against the new repo (and made the empty Ask view look like
  a broken Search). The query clears with the rest of the per-repo state.

## 0.12.0 — the studio as a public demo: --readonly + --rate-limit

- **`--readonly`** (studio / serve-api): serve the indexed repos, refuse every
  mutating/config route server-side with a 403 (`/index`, `/index/stream`,
  `/repos/add`, `/scan`, `/fs/pick`, `/providers/select`,
  `/providers/ollama/serve`, `/flows/delete` — one `READONLY_BLOCKED` set next
  to the route table). The SAME UI bundle adapts: it reads the new
  `GET /config` (`{readonly, rate_limit, version}`, auth-exempt like /health)
  and hides Add repo, settings/providers, re-index, flow deletes and cold
  registry rows — no forked demo UI, one source of truth; the lock never
  depends on the UI.
- **`--rate-limit N`**: at most N LLM asks (`/ask` + `/ask/stream`) per hour
  per client IP — 429 with the retry seconds. Retrieval routes stay unlimited
  (local, ~free). `--trust-proxy` takes the client IP from X-Forwarded-For
  (off by default: the header is spoofable).
- **The studio now works behind a path prefix.** api.js resolved every route
  absolutely (`/repos`), so nginx-mounting the studio under
  `/megabrain/demo/` broke every fetch; routes now resolve relative to the
  page's directory. At the root nothing changes.
- Together these replace the hand-rolled demo backend on bernardocastro.dev:
  the public demo becomes `pip install megabrain` + `megabrain studio
  --readonly --rate-limit 30 --trust-proxy` behind nginx.

## 0.11.0 — the cache you can read: a Flows tab, starter queries, flows over MCP

- **Studio Flows tab — the ask cache, listed and viewable.** Every cached ask
  (flow) newest-first: question, cited files, when it was cached, `stale`
  when a source changed; click one for the stored walkthrough exactly as it
  will be served, each cited file openable in the code navigator; delete
  inline. New routes `GET /flows` (list, no text), `GET /flow?id=` (full),
  `POST /flows/delete {id}` — thin adapters over new `app.flows_list/
  flow_get/flow_delete` use-cases. Flow rows now record a `created` timestamp
  (in-place ALTER migration, like qvec; old rows show "—").
- **The cache is visible in Ask.** A verbatim serve shows a
  "⚡ served from flow cache" banner (no LLM · retrieval ms · the original
  cached question) and the synthesis header reads "FROM CACHE" instead of a
  model name. Flows that ATTACH as KNOWN-FLOW context (0.62–0.88 match) show
  as "known flows" chips in the info bar — the `retrieval` stream event now
  carries `flows: [{question, score}]`.
- **`megabrain_flows` gains `get` and `delete` (MCP).** The action enum now
  covers `list` (which finally returns flow **ids**, plus `created` and
  `stale`), `get` (one cached walkthrough in full, by id — free: no LLM, no
  retrieval) and `delete`. All three route through the same `app.*`
  use-cases serve-api calls, replacing the hand-rolled Store query that had
  drifted from it. An agent can now read what a teammate already asked
  instead of paying to re-ask it.
- **Staleness is measured against DISK, not the index.** `stale_flows()`
  compares a flow's cited shas to the *index*, which legitimately lags disk
  by up to the 60 s refresh TTL — so a freshly cached, perfectly serveable
  flow showed up as `stale`. The listing now uses the same disk check the
  serve path makes, extracted as `flows.files_current()` and shared by both
  (it was inline in `serve_verbatim`). `Store.stale_flows()` is unchanged —
  index consistency is the right question for the *pruning* path.
- **`.megabrainqueries` — committable starter queries.** One query per line
  (`#` comments) at the repo root; `GET /queries` serves them and the studio
  renders them as one-click chips under the Ask bar, plus an explicit
  **⚡ Warm all** button that runs each starter once (buffered `POST /ask`)
  and caches it as a flow. The onboarding play: a newcomer opens the repo,
  clicks through the starters, and sees the main workflows — instantly if
  someone already warmed them. This repo ships its own `.megabrainqueries`.

## 0.10.0 — the repo as a graph · flow cache on by default · search rerank

- **Flow cache ON by default** (was opt-in since its introduction). Measured
  on this repo: a repeated ask (even reworded) drops from 27.8 s to **0.19 s
  with zero LLM**, and correctness is guarded per serve by a byte-level
  sha256 recheck of every cited file — editing a cited file makes the next
  ask narrate fresh and re-cache, never serve stale. Meta absent = on, so
  existing indexes flip on without a re-index. Opt out per repo with
  `megabrain flows --disable` (persisted), or globally with
  `MEGABRAIN_FLOW_CACHE=0` (the kill beats a per-repo enable). The two costs
  this trades: `ask` now writes to the repo's `.megabrain/db.sqlite` (one
  embed + one INSERT), and related questions may attach up to 3 flow-source
  files to the bundle (pure additions, never displacing ranked files).
  `--warm-flows` / `flows --warm` stay explicit commands (they cost real LLM
  asks); warming re-enables an opted-out repo.
- **`megabrain_graph` — the repo as a navigable knowledge graph (new MCP tool
  / CLI verb / `GET /graph` / studio tab).** Built from what indexing already
  owns: AST import/call edges (structural lane) + skeleton-embedding cosine
  (semantic lane — similar files with no import between them, honestly
  scored). Deterministic weighted label propagation for communities (numpy
  only, no networkx), god nodes by degree, "surprising connections"
  (cosine ≥0.85 + no structural edge + different communities), BFS paths
  with the carrying edge kind per hop, and endpoints resolved by EMBEDDING —
  `megabrain graph . --node "the scoring pipeline"` lands on `scoring.py`.
  The one LLM touch is community labeling: a single buffered call, cached in
  the store's meta under a graph fingerprint, fail-open to "Community N".
  Node views splice the store's REAL chunks (new `Store.all_edges()` /
  `Store.file_chunks()`). Measured: this repo 122 files/324 links in 8ms;
  graphify's own 630-file repo in 37ms. Where graphify needs LLM sub-agents
  to extract relationships, megabrain gets the graph for free at index time.
- **`megabrain_query` → `megabrain_search`** (breaking, with a net): the tool
  IS a search and the engine already speaks that vocabulary
  (`search_with_state`/`prune_search`); "query" read as SQL. TOOLS lists only
  `megabrain_search`; `call_tool` still accepts `megabrain_query`, so
  registered 0.9 clients keep working at zero agent-context cost. CLI:
  `megabrain search` is the primary verb, `query` a hidden alias.
- **LLM rerank on search (`llm_prune`)** — the deterministic prune is
  recall-safe by design, so files that merely share vocabulary with the query
  (tests, evals, A/B gates) survive as signal. A cheap buffered LLM call now
  sees a compact candidate listing (ids + spans + hints, never bodies) and
  returns the relevant ids ordered; the engine keeps its own verbatim chunks
  (the model selects, never writes code) and ANY failure returns the
  deterministic result untouched. Defaults: MCP `rerank: true`, CLI
  `search --rerank` opt-in (keeps the 2ms path), `GET /prune?rerank=1`.
  Model: `MEGABRAIN_RERANK_MODEL` (else the ask default). Measured on the
  motivating query ("how does retrieval scoring work"): 21 signal chunks → 6,
  the three scoring.py lanes ranked 1-2-3, every eval/test tangential dropped.
- **Global repo registry** — every `index_repo` now registers its repo in
  `~/.megabrain/registry.json` (override `MEGABRAIN_REGISTRY`; atomic writes;
  fail-open; self-healing — entries whose index vanished are dropped on
  read). Surfaces: `megabrain repos` (CLI), `megabrain_index list=true`
  (MCP), and `GET /repos` merges the server's warm sessions
  (`loaded: true`) with registry-only repos (`loaded: false`) so the studio
  rail shows EVERY indexed repo on the machine — clicking a cold one loads it.
- **Studio: Graph tab** — a force-directed canvas (vanilla, no libs) over
  `/graph`: nodes colored by community with labels at centroids, god nodes
  haloed, solid structural vs dashed semantic edges, drag/zoom/pan, click a
  node for its neighbors + symbols + real chunks, and `A -> B` in the query
  bar traces a highlighted path. Physics stays cheap via per-community
  repulsion (no global O(n²)). Prune view gains the LLM-rerank toggle.
- **Studio: the add-repo file tree, rebuilt.** The old tree re-rendered the
  whole overlay on every toggle, so each click threw the scroll position back
  to the top, and re-including one file under an excluded folder was flatly
  refused ("re-include the parent folder first"). Now: a targeted repaint
  keeps scroll and input focus; whole rows are clickable (folders expand,
  files toggle, VS-Code style); re-including a child performs a **rule split**
  — the excluded ancestor is replaced by exclusions of its siblings, so the
  selection stays expressible as plain `.megabrainignore` lines (which have no
  `!` negation). Adds tri-state folder checkboxes with real `included/total`
  counts, a filter box with match highlighting and auto-expansion of hits,
  full keyboard navigation (↑↓ move, →← expand/collapse, space toggles),
  All/None/Expand/Collapse actions, indent guides, and a footer stating how
  many ignore rules the choice will write. Light theme: the brand glyph is
  white on the accent gradient (it was near-black, unreadable).

### Also in 0.10.0 — local-model knobs

- **`MEGABRAIN_CHAT_EXTRA`** — a JSON object shallow-merged into every
  OpenAI-compat chat body (streamed and not; extras win, so a knob can be
  forced). The provider-param escape hatch, born from a real wall: Ollama's
  `/v1/chat/completions` **ignores** the native `think:false`, so hybrid
  qwen3 models silently burned ~265 hidden reasoning tokens per `ask` answer;
  `'{"reasoning_effort": "none"}'` is the field Ollama honors and it pins them
  to pure instruct mode. Chat-only (never leaks into `/embeddings`), ignored
  by the claude provider, malformed JSON fails loud (a silently-dropped knob
  corrupts any measurement that relied on it).
- **`MEGABRAIN_ASK_CTX_CHARS`** — override `ask`'s candidate-prompt budget
  (default 200K chars ≈ 50K tokens, sized for cloud windows). Local models
  have smaller windows and runtimes truncate silently: golden bundles measure
  29–58K tokens vs qwen3:14b's 40960 cap, so 5/6 eval prompts were being cut
  without a trace. Cap the budget under the model's window instead.
- Fully-local stack re-measured on an RTX 3090 (docs/GUIDE.md §2b updated with
  same-day controls): jina-code Q8 GGUF ties bge-m3 on bundle_full 0.909 at
  7× less memory; qwen3-coder:30b stays the local ask pick. Lab log in
  `evals/LOCAL_MODELS.md` §(f).

## 0.9.1 — Windows: stop silently corrupting non-ASCII code · `megabrain install`

- **Fix (Windows, silent data corruption): every file read is now explicitly
  UTF-8.** The engine read source with `read_text(errors="replace")` and no
  `encoding=`, so it decoded with the *platform default* — cp1252 on Windows.
  It never raised (`errors="replace"` swallowed it), it just indexed mojibake:
  a file containing `# año` was chunked, embedded and returned as `# aÃ±o`.
  Every non-ASCII comment, string, or identifier (accents, CJK, emoji, em-dashes)
  was silently corrupted for Windows users, in the index AND in what `ask`/`query`
  handed back. All 27 read/write sites across the indexer, retrieval, forge,
  flows, strategies and the servers now pin `encoding="utf-8"` (keeping
  `errors="replace"` so a genuinely broken file still can't crash a run).
  Windows CI was red on this since 0.8.0 — it's green again.
- **`megabrain install`** registers the MCP server with every AI coding assistant

- **`megabrain install`** registers the MCP server with every AI coding assistant
  detected on the machine — **Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf,
  Gemini CLI**. MCP is portable, so the same stdio server runs in all of them;
  only the config file (path/format/key) differs, and that table now lives in
  `server/install.py`. `--list` previews, `--platform` narrows, `--remove`
  unregisters. It writes **only** the `megabrain` key (other servers survive) and
  pins the entry to `sys.executable`, so re-running repairs a config that drifted
  to a stale checkout/PYTHONPATH. Codex's TOML gets a targeted section
  replace/append so comments and other servers survive (no TOML writer in the
  stdlib, and megabrain still takes no dependencies).
- **`megabrain serve` is the studio** (web UI at `/` **+** the JSON API);
  **`megabrain serve-api` is now the JSON API ONLY**, no UI mounted. Previously
  `serve-api` served both and `--no-ui` opted out — that conflated two concerns
  (the name says "api", so it shouldn't ship a UI). The `--no-ui` flag is gone;
  pick the command that matches what you want. Both share every option
  (`--port/--host/--cors/--no-llm/--token`) and drive the same `serve()`.

## 0.9.0 — MCP surface: lean, and `megabrain_query` is always signal-only

**BREAKING (MCP tool contract):**

- **Removed `megabrain_get` and `megabrain_chunks`.** Every tool costs the
  calling agent context and a routing decision, so the MCP surface now exposes
  only what megabrain alone can do — pulling a single file or symbol is the
  host's own Read/Grep job (and `ask`'s sub-agents already fetch files
  internally via their own tools). Five tools remain: `megabrain_ask`,
  `megabrain_query`, `megabrain_index`, `megabrain_forge`, `megabrain_flows`.
  The underlying `app.get`/`app.chunks` are unaffected — the CLI and serve-api
  (`/get`, `/chunks`) still use them.
- **`megabrain_query` always returns the pruned signal list now** — the
  `prune_noise` and `full` params are gone. The file-grouped bundle's RELATED
  section was a code-less map, a dead end over MCP once `get`/`chunks` were
  removed (no tool to expand it). Pruning has no such gap: every file in the
  bundle still contributes its best chunk *with code* — only the noisy chunks
  inside files are cut, so nothing relevant is lost, and one call now always
  hands the agent real code. The CLI (`query` vs `query --prune`) and HTTP API
  still expose both shapes.
- `megabrain_query`'s `compact` param now declares its default explicitly
  (`false` — code bodies included) instead of leaving it implicit.

No engine/CLI/HTTP changes — this release is MCP-contract-only.

## 0.8.1 — studio add-repo: native folder dialog + interactive file tree

- **Native OS folder picker.** Add-repo's "Browse…" opens the operating
  system's OWN folder dialog (`GET /fs/pick` → Finder on macOS via `osascript`,
  GTK/KDE on Linux, folders-only) and returns the absolute path — the one thing
  a browser will never hand over. Falls back to the manual path field on a
  headless box. (Replaces the earlier server-side HTML browser.)
- **Choose what indexes, as a tree.** The scan review is now an interactive
  file tree (lucide-style icons, expand/collapse, per-node checkboxes with an
  indeterminate state, All/None) built from the scan's new `paths`. The
  "N files will index" count updates live; excluded nodes become
  `.megabrainignore` lines applied before indexing. Auto-skipped
  (gitignore/vendored/generated) stays in a collapsible detail.
- **Tokened demo.** The studio reads `?token=` from its URL (then localStorage)
  and sends `Authorization: Bearer` on every request, so serve-api can run with
  `--token` behind a public port and a tokenized link is all you share.
- `scan()` returns `paths` (indexable rel paths, capped) for the tree.

## 0.8.0 — megabrain studio (serve-api web UI) + scan

- **megabrain studio.** `megabrain serve-api ~/repo` serves a local web UI at
  `/` (`server/ui/`, vanilla + system fonts, no CDN): search with the chunk
  heatmap, the prune signal/noise view, the multi-agent `ask` live-view, a
  providers panel (Claude SDK · OpenRouter · Ollama, auto-detected) with a
  model picker, and an **add-repo flow that scans first** then indexes behind a
  **live progress bar**. `--no-ui` for JSON-only.
- **Live provider switching + local Ollama.** `POST /providers/select
  {provider, model?}` repoints the CHAT role at Claude/OpenRouter/Ollama for
  subsequent calls (`providers.select()`, set-and-leave under a lock — never
  touches embeddings); `POST /providers/ollama/serve` starts `ollama serve`
  when the binary is present but the server is down (`providers.start_ollama()`).
  `detect()` now reports `ollama.installed` + `active.label` (the logical
  provider — a localhost chat base reads as ollama). serve-api **defaults to
  OpenRouter** when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is present (env or `~/.zshrc`) and the
  provider isn't explicitly pinned. The studio hides embedding models from the
  Ollama *chat* picker (they can't narrate) and hints `ollama pull` when only
  embeddings are local.
- **Re-index with a different embedding.** `POST /index/stream` accepts
  `embed_model` (+ `embed_base` for a local endpoint): sets the model so BOTH
  the re-index AND subsequent query embedding use it (a model change re-embeds
  every file). `/repos` + `/health` + the index `done` event now carry
  `embed_model` so you always know which embedding an index used. The studio's
  local embedding preset is **jina-code** (`unclemusclez/jina-embeddings-v2-
  base-code` via Ollama) — verified indexing + search on a fully-local repo.
- **Syntax highlighting** in the studio — a small dependency-free scanner
  (Python/JS/Go/Rust + a generic fallback), applied to the search chunk
  heatmap, the prune signal chunks, and the `ask` spliced code blocks.
- **New serve-api routes:** `GET /providers` (`providers.detect()`),
  `GET /scan?path=`, `GET /prune`, `GET /repos`, `POST /repos/add`,
  `POST /index/stream` (SSE per-file progress via a new `on_progress` indexer
  hook). Every route accepts an optional `?repo=`/`"repo"` (multi-repo
  registry). `POST /ask` + `/ask/stream` accept an optional `model`, threaded
  cleanly through the ask pipeline (no env mutation).
- **`scan` — index intelligence** (`indexing/ignore.py`): a stdlib `.gitignore`
  matcher + Linguist-style vendored/generated detection + a census. CLI
  `megabrain scan [--write]`, `index --scan|--dry-run`; the studio add-repo
  flow shows it before committing. Deterministic and opt-in — a plain `index`
  is byte-identical.
- **Fix:** broken relative imports from the `arch(D)` refactor
  (`docsearch.py`, `session.py`) that crashed `serve-api` at boot.

### Also shipped in 0.8.0 — the art-of-code refactor (v2)

Internal architecture pass toward the "art of code" layering. **No public
contract changed**: the CLI/MCP/serve-api surfaces, the on-disk index + trust
formats, and the Python API are byte-compatible; MCP tool schemas and chunker
output are pinned byte-for-byte by new golden tests. See `REFACTOR.md`.

- **One `ask` pipeline.** `ask()` is now a buffered collector over
  `stream_events`; the flow-cache read AND write live in that single pipeline.
  Fixes a real divergence where CLI/SSE asks never populated the flow cache.
- **Structured errors** (`megabrain/errors.py`): a `MegabrainError` taxonomy
  with `code` + `http_status`; one catch site per frontend (CLI no longer dumps
  tracebacks; HTTP no longer leaks internals).
- **`ChatProvider` Protocol + registry** (`providers/base.py`): the three
  provider if-switches collapse into `resolve()`; `agent_stream` is a probed
  capability. Mirrors the `ChunkStrategy` pattern.
- **`ChunkMeta`** (`megabrain/model.py`): the chunk row is a frozen typed
  record end-to-end; the SQL column order lives only in `store.py`.
- **`RetrievalParams`** (`retrieval/params.py`): every tuning knob in one frozen,
  injectable record (sweeps replace() it instead of monkeypatching globals).
- **`query.py` split** into `state / scoring / bundle / render / files`;
  `query.py` is now a compatibility facade. `selection()` is the single
  definition of signal (prune + chunks_for_file are projections of it).
- **`app.py` application-service layer**: one use-case per verb + the shared
  pre-steps (resolve/rel_join/agents tri-state/reindex) all frontends call.
  `docsearch.py` and `session.py` (RepoSession) extracted from the HTTP handler.
- **One cAST engine** (`chunkers/cast.py`): `merge_units` / `greedy_pack` /
  `pack_lines`, shared by the Python and tree-sitter chunkers (were duplicated).
  Byte-identity proven by `tests/test_cast_unification.py`.
- **Scoring lanes**: `score_chunks` is a self-gating `ScoreLane` pipeline
  (dense+fusion · test-penalty · issue · lexical) over one `QueryCtx` — adding a
  signal is one lane class + one entry (OCP). Bit-identical: a float-array
  differential harness (`tests/test_scoring_lanes.py`) proves no score moved.
- **src/ layout + one subpackage per layer** (PyPA standard): `storage/`
  (store + flow-cache mechanics), `ask/` (narrator · agents · warmup — the LLM
  half of flows cut out so storage never imports upward), `forge/` (coverage ·
  ab_gate · specialize), `server/` (cli · mcp · http · session),
  `retrieval/docsearch`, `__main__.py`. Package root keeps only the
  cross-cutting spine. `python3 -m megabrain.mcp_server` and the `megabrain`
  script are unchanged; `from megabrain.ask import ask` still works (package
  interface). No compatibility facades: every import names the real module.
- **Anti-shadowing guard** (`tests/test_no_shadowing.py`): an editable install
  of the old engine can silently fill in missing `megabrain.*` names via
  setuptools' meta-path finder; the guard asserts every loaded module lives
  under this repo's `src/` and retired names never resolve from here.
- **`TreeChunkerOps`** public contract for the php→tree-sitter reuse seam.
- **Lifecycle**: `SearchState`/`Store` close via context managers everywhere;
  `index_repo` owns its connection and returns stats (the library never prints).
- **Layering**: indexing no longer imports the `flows` feature module
  (stale-flow invalidation is now `Store` integrity).

## 0.7.2 — 2026-07-11

- **`prune_noise` — NO-LLM noise pruning on the query path.** A new option
  (`megabrain query --prune`, MCP `megabrain_query` `prune_noise: true`,
  `prune_search()` / `render_pruned()` in the library) that runs the normal
  retrieval and then returns ONLY the SELECTED (signal) chunks as a FLAT list
  ranked by relevance — `[id] file:lines · score` + code — with the noise
  dropped. It reuses the exact signal/noise selection the engine already
  computes (a tier-1 chunk surviving the CHUNK_KEEP_RATIO cut, or a related
  file's best chunk), so it's deterministic, has no LLM and no token cost. It is
  the lean alternative to `ask` when the caller just needs the right code to
  read, not a narration — a modern LLM needs no pre-filtered prose, so `ask` is
  deliberately left as-is (no pre-filter: that would be double work). Opt-in:
  default `megabrain_query` still returns the full file-grouped bundle.
  `prune_search(..., include_pruned=True)` also returns the dropped chunks under
  `"noise"` for a signal-vs-noise diff view (powers the demo's prune view).

## 0.7.1 — 2026-07-11

- **Fix: CommonJS/prototype methods (`obj.prop = function(){}`) were invisible
  to the JS chunker.** The TS/JS spec captured only `function_declaration` /
  `method_definition` / `lexical_declaration`, so express's entire router API —
  `proto.use`, `proto.handle`, `Route.prototype.dispatch`, … — produced NO
  symbols: unlabelable in `ask` (citations fell back to listing the file's
  `require()` consts, e.g. "appendMethods, getPathname, gettype"), and absent
  from the file skeleton used in scoring. New `assign_defs` spec flag (on for
  TS/JS) captures `member = function/arrow` assignments as method symbols named
  by their full LHS (`Route.prototype.dispatch`). Verified on express: the
  `next()` walkthrough now labels every citation correctly
  (`proto.handle`, `Layer.prototype.handle_request`) — line partition
  unchanged, all chunker tests green.
- **Fix: `ask` sub-range citations landed a few lines off, cutting functions
  mid-body.** The prompt showed each chunk's text RAW with only a header line
  range, so the model had to count lines itself to cite `[[k:lo-hi]]` — cites
  started on a neighbor's trailing lines and stopped mid-method. Chunk text in
  the prompt is now prefixed with absolute file line numbers (`1234| code`,
  prompt-only — splicing still uses the clean text from disk) and the rules
  require reading lo/hi off those prefixes and citing complete units (signature
  → closing line). Verified on sinatra's routing walkthrough: 8/8 citations now
  open at `def` and close at its `end` (before: mid-method cuts and orphan
  tails).
- **Fix: Ruby `class << self` regions chunked blind.** `singleton_class` was
  missing from `RUBY_SPEC` (not a container, not a def type), so the whole
  region — sinatra's entire `get/post/route/compile!` DSL — became anonymous
  size-packed `block` chunks with NO symbols: unnamed in rankings, unlabelable
  and unsnappable in `ask` citations. Now a named container (`self`, via the
  node's `value` field): methods inside become real symbols
  (`Sinatra.Base.self.get`), merged chunks carry names, and citation
  snap-to-symbol works there.

- **Fix: the test-file down-weight missed `test/` (singular) and `spec/`
  directories.** The detector checked only the SECOND path component for the
  substring "test" plus `tests/` (plural), so repos laid out as `test/…`
  (express, ky) or `spec/…` (Ruby) never received `TEST_PENALTY` — test files
  outranked the core they exercise ("how are retries and timeouts implemented?"
  on ky returned `test/retry.ts` above `source/core/Ky.ts`). New `_is_test_path`:
  any path segment named `test/tests/spec/specs/__tests__/testing`
  (segment-exact, never substring) or a token-ish `test`/`spec` in the filename
  (`foo_test.go`, `test_foo.py`, `foo.spec.ts` — but not `inspect.py`).
  Golden set unchanged: R@1 0.864, bundle_full 0.955.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-11

- **Serve-from-cache: a repeated `ask` costs $0 and ~0 ms.** Flows now store the
  RENDERED answer (prose + real code spliced from disk) and TWO vectors —
  question+prose (the attach lane) and question-only (the serve lane, so prose
  length can't dilute an identical question). When a question near-exactly
  matches a cached flow (qscore ≥ 0.88) AND every cited file is still
  byte-identical (sha recheck at serve time — stale code is never served), the
  cached answer returns verbatim with no LLM call: measured 6.9 s → **0.02 s**
  (345×) on a repeat ask; a re-worded near-exact variant also serves. Wired in
  `ask()` (MCP/library) and `stream_ask` (CLI); `render_ask` shows "⚡ served
  from flow cache". Dedup now keys on the question lane (two narrations of one
  question replace, not accumulate). Paraphrases in the 0.62–0.88 band attach
  as context and narrate fresh, as before.
- **Default ask model → `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`** — measured ~2× faster
  than qwen3-coder on a real walkthrough (~6-7 s vs ~14 s) at comparable
  quality ($0.50/$3.00 vs $0.22/$1.80 per M). `MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL=qwen/
  qwen3-coder` for the cheapest/broadest-citation option; Claude provider
  default unchanged (haiku).
- **docs/GUIDE**: query-vs-ask decision table (aimed at LLM agents calling the
  MCP), the three flow-cache tiers with the measured numbers, updated model
  table.

- **Flow cache — self-caching workflow retrieval** (`megabrain/flows.py`).
  **Opt-in, OFF by default** — a mode a dev turns on per repo
  (`megabrain flows --enable`, implied by `--warm-flows`; env
  `MEGABRAIN_FLOW_CACHE` forces on/off globally). When off, `query`/`ask`
  behave exactly as before at zero cost (load_state skips flows entirely).
  When on: every successful `ask` synthesizes a cross-file walkthrough (a workflow:
  "VAD detects speech → TurnController.on_vad_start → cancel TTS") that the
  engine used to throw away. Now it is cached in the index (`flows` table:
  question + prose + {cited file: sha} + embedding) and the NEXT related
  question retrieves the whole flow at once — validated: a barge-in flow
  cached from one question was retrieved by a fully re-worded paraphrase.
  Design keeps every hard rule intact: the LLM and the one embed call happen
  at ASK time (write path); the read path is pure cosine against the flow
  matrix, reusing the query vector already computed (no second embed, no LLM).
  Flows ATTACH to the bundle (a "KNOWN FLOW" section + non-citable context for
  the narrator) and never rank or displace files — their source files append
  to RELATED only when missing, pure additions, so bundle_full can only rise.
  Invalidation: index_repo prunes any flow whose cited files changed sha, so a
  stale walkthrough cannot outlive the code it describes (and `ask` splices
  real code from disk regardless — a stale flow can mis-prioritize, never
  fabricate). Near-duplicate flows replace instead of piling up. **Warmup**
  (opt-in): `megabrain index --warm-flows N` / `flows --warm N` — right after
  the first index, an index-time LLM planner reads the graph's hub files and
  writes N research questions covering the system's main workflows, then runs
  one `ask` each, so the cache starts full instead of building up lazily. CLI:
  `megabrain flows <repo> [--enable|--disable|--warm N|--clear]`; kill switch
  `MEGABRAIN_FLOW_CACHE=0`. **Refresh, not just expire** — `megabrain flows
  --refresh` re-asks each stale flow's ORIGINAL question against the current
  code and regenerates the walkthrough (opt-in: one `ask` per changed flow),
  so the cache stays *current* rather than only *not-wrong*; `index_repo`
  gained `prune_flows=False` so refresh can reindex-then-regenerate without the
  default prune dropping the flows first. Related literature: Knowledge
  Compression via Question Generation (arxiv 2506.13778) — indexing synthesized
  knowledge lifts multi-hop retrieval.
- **New: [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md)** — a step-by-step usage guide
  (providers with options, indexing, the 2000-vs-4000 budget choice, how the
  engine measures a strategy, the flow cache).

- **Removed LLM-generated specialization strategies.** Across four repos
  (sinatra, requests, sdk-server, the engine itself) an LLM asked to write a
  specialization chunker consistently LOST — to a five-line deterministic
  recipe (`lit_baseline`: the AST chunker re-budgeted to 2000) and to the plain
  4000 default. `forge_specialize` no longer calls a model; it is now a
  measurement toolkit for HAND-WRITTEN strategies: `detect_specialization`
  (where the built-in chunks poorly), `lit_baseline` (the reference to beat),
  and `gate_strategy(root, source, ext)` — measure a hand-written chunker with
  `forge_eval.ab_gate` and install it trust-gated only if it wins. CLI
  `forge --specialize` now only lists opportunities; the MCP `specialize` mode
  returns opportunities + a note. (Coverage `forge` for UNCOVERED extensions is
  unchanged.)
- **Documented the sacred-bar finding.** On the sdk-server golden set (the one
  corpus with human-verified queries), no chunk budget beats 4000: R@1 4000=0.86,
  2000=0.82, surgical blob-splitting=0.77. Tighter chunks improve span-IoU
  (navigation — less to read) but LOWER retrieval ranking, because the 4000 merge
  concentrates a file's evidence and that is what wins R@1. `DEFAULT_BUDGET`
  stays 4000; specialization is an honest win only for its navigation objective.

- **`forge --specialize` — chunkers tuned to a repo's own conventions**
  (`megabrain/forge_specialize.py` + `megabrain/forge_eval.py`; CLI
  `megabrain forge --specialize [--list|--dry-run|--ext .x]`, MCP
  `megabrain_forge` `specialize` param). Coverage forge teaches the engine file
  types it can't read; specialization re-chunks types it ALREADY reads where
  the generic chunker fits poorly — a module that is one giant lookup table
  becomes a blob, so a query about one entry retrieves the whole file. The
  detector diagnoses three shapes (dominant dict/list table, blob, line-window
  fallback); parallel LLMs write **shape-routers** (split the diagnosed shape
  into tight named chunks, delegate every normal file to the built-in
  byte-identically via the new `builtin_strategy_for`). Because a
  partition-valid chunker can still be *worse* than the built-in, installs are
  gated by a **measured retrieval A/B** (`forge_eval.ab_gate`): neutral probe
  spans derived from the file's own structure (no labels, no LLM), both
  variants indexed for real, and **rank-aware span-IoU** — the file's
  top-ranked chunk vs the true span, what retrieval actually surfaces — plus
  global hit@k scored on every file the candidate changes. Win requires the
  pooled IoU lift ≥ 0.01 AND hit@1 held AND no per-file regression AND no
  micro-chunking (median chunk ≥ 100 nws, rejected before any indexing); a
  losing candidate gets one regeneration seeded with the measured result. The
  strict gate earned its clauses in the wild: a candidate that scored a fake
  "0.55 IoU win" via median 1-line chunks measures Δ-0.001 with hit@1
  regressing under it, and is rejected. Wins that survive: psf/requests
  `status_codes.py` IoU 0.010 → 0.076 / hit@1 0.23 → 0.47 (2×); sinatra `.rb`
  IoU 0.037 → 0.115 with zero per-file regressions — all other files
  byte-identical in both.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-11

- **`forge` — megabrain writes its own chunkers** (`megabrain/forge.py`). CLI
  `megabrain forge [--list|--dry-run|--ext .x]`, MCP `megabrain_forge`. Detects
  the repo's uncovered text extensions (deterministic census), LLM-generates a
  `ChunkStrategy` per type from the contract source + real samples (the `ask`
  provider stack; `MEGABRAIN_FORGE_MODEL` to pin), and installs it only after it
  chunks EVERY matching file with a clean `validate_partition` (repair loop ≤3
  attempts — unvetted code can never install). Verified on pallets/click: `.toml`
  + `.yaml` forged first-attempt in ~28 s; "which workflow runs the tests" went
  from a full miss to `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` #1.
- **Repo-local strategies, trust-gated** (`indexing/strategies.py`). Vetted
  modules in `<repo>/.megabrain/strategies/*.py` load automatically on every
  `index_repo` — including the 60 s auto-refresh, which previously pruned
  custom-extension files as orphans. Loading only happens when the module's
  sha256 matches `~/.megabrain/trust.json` (user-level — a cloned repo cannot
  self-approve); `megabrain trust <repo>` approves hand-written modules, and any
  edit un-trusts the file until re-approved.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-06

- **`ask v2` — adaptive multi-agent synthesis** (`megabrain/ask_agents.py`).
  When a question is broad and single-shot retrieval isn't confident, `ask`
  fans out: a no-LLM classifier reads the bundle shape, a planner splits it
  into ≤4 scoped slices, parallel sub-agents (each with the repo map + no-LLM
  retrieval tools `search_more`/`get_file`/`get_symbol`) explain their slice,
  and a parent synthesizes with the same global `[[k]]` citation-splice — code
  stays verbatim. Every stage fails open to single-agent `ask`. Surfaces: CLI
  `ask --agents/--no-agents` (default AUTO), MCP `agents` param, serve-api
  `POST /ask/stream` (SSE live view). Scoped questions never pay for it, and no
  LLM ever enters the retrieval path (rule 1 holds). Gates green: full suite +
  golden (bundle_full 1.00, R@1 0.86) + multi + scale.
- Provider tool-calling: `stream_chat(with_tools=True)` parses OpenAI
  `tool_calls`; the Claude path registers the retrieval tools as an in-process
  SDK MCP server.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-07-06

- **Internal package reorg** — the tree now mirrors the pipeline: `chunkers/` ·
  `indexing/` (indexer, strategies, graph) · `retrieval/` (query, issue, bm25,
  rerank) · `providers/` (chat routing, claude, embeddings) · `frontends/`
  (cli, mcp, http), with `ask.py`/`store.py` at the root. The **public API is
  unchanged** (`megabrain.{index_repo, search, …}`, `megabrain.ask`), and
  `python3 -m megabrain.mcp_server` keeps working via a launcher shim. Deep
  imports of old module paths (`megabrain.query`, `megabrain.indexer`,
  `megabrain.serve`, `megabrain.chunker*`) moved to their new homes.
- Versioning policy going forward: patch-first, publish only when there's a
  reason (see CONTRIBUTING → Releasing).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-06

Open-source readiness release. Retrieval behavior is unchanged where it counts:
all three retrieval gates hold the locked bar (golden R@1 0.86 · bundle_full
1.00 · scale p50 < 20 ms).

### Fixed
- **Windows: indexes were corrupt** — relpaths were stored with `\` while the
  whole engine matches on `/` (DB keys, excludes, path filters, graph edges,
  `chunks`/`get` lookups), so nothing resolved. Relpaths are now POSIX on every
  platform. (Caught by the new Windows CI matrix.)

### Security
- `get_code` now enforces repo-root containment — `../` and absolute paths can
  no longer escape the index root (was reachable via `serve-api GET /get` and
  MCP `megabrain_get`).
- `serve-api` gained optional Bearer auth: `--token` / `MEGABRAIN_API_TOKEN`
  guards every endpoint except `/health`; a warning is printed when binding
  beyond localhost without one.

### Changed
- **`query` renders RELATED as a map by default** (file, best-match span,
  symbols — no chunk code bodies; CLI `--full` / MCP `full: true` restores
  them). Measured on the golden set: RELATED holds 45% of the gold files so it
  can't be dropped, but its code bodies were ~16K of a ~22K-token bundle at
  ~5% verified signal — they flooded agent context windows. The bundle DATA is
  unchanged (`ask`/HTTP consumers keep `best_chunk`), all three retrieval
  gates hold (bundle_full 1.00), and a typical bundle drops ~22K → ~8K tokens.
- **Default index excludes trimmed to universal dirs.** `data`, `logs` and
  maintainer-local names are no longer skipped by default — add them to your
  repo's `.megabrainignore` if you relied on that. New defaults add `.tox`,
  `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `target`, `vendor`, `.nuxt`.
- **Chunkers moved to `megabrain.chunkers`** (`base` / `python` / `treesitter`
  / `php` / `markdown`). The old module paths (`megabrain.chunker`,
  `chunker_ts`, `chunker_php`, `markdown`) remain as deprecation shims for one
  release.
- Rerank v1 removed (unused); `rerank2.haiku_order2` is now
  `rerank.llm_order` (the default model has been qwen3-coder since the
  OpenRouter move).
- `/docsearch` result groups are now per-deployment config
  (`.megabrain/docsearch.json` or `MEGABRAIN_DOCSEARCH_GROUPS`) instead of
  hardcoded section names; unmatched slugs group under "Docs".
- CLI: single-path commands now error on comma multi-path input instead of
  silently dropping everything after the first comma.

### Added
- `ask --with-docs` (MCP `include_docs`, HTTP `include_docs`): explain code
  AND docs together — third mode next to the default (code only) and `--docs`
  (docs only).
- CLI `ask`/`query`/`chunks` now auto-refresh a stale index before answering
  (60 s TTL, incremental, fail-open without a key) — previously only the MCP
  server did, so CLI answers could cite stale code after an edit.
- **Claude chat provider** (extra `megabrain[claude]`): `ask`/`--best` stream
  through the Claude Agent SDK — Claude Code **subscription credits** when the
  CLI is logged in, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for API billing. Default model
  `haiku` (`MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL` accepts any Claude model/alias). The chat
  provider **defaults to auto**: Claude when its SDK is importable, else
  OpenRouter — pin with `MEGABRAIN_CHAT_PROVIDER=claude|openrouter`. Embeddings
  are unaffected and still require OpenRouter or a local embed endpoint.
- **Custom chunking strategies**: `index_repo(root, strategies=[MyStrategy()])`
  plugs any content type in without forking (checked before the built-ins, so
  a custom strategy can also override one). New `ChunkStrategy` protocol;
  `Chunk`/`Symbol`/`FileResult`/`validate_partition` exported at top level.
- `examples/`: programmatic API walkthrough, a complete custom `.sql` chunker
  (offline-runnable), and a terminal chunk-score heatmap.
- Lazy public API: `megabrain.{index_repo, search, render, get_code,
  load_state, search_with_state, Store}` (importing `megabrain` no longer
  pulls numpy/tree_sitter) + `py.typed`.
- Issue grounding beyond Python: JS/TS stack frames (`at fn (src/x.ts:12:5)`)
  pin files/spans; explicit `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx/.mjs/.cjs/.rb/.go/.rs/.php`
  paths ground like `.py` paths.
- TS import graph: dynamic `import()`, side-effect imports, and
  `.jsx/.mjs/.cjs`/`index.js` resolution.
- `MEGABRAIN_DEBUG=1` surfaces previously-swallowed provider errors.

### Performance
- `ask` loads retrieval state once per question (was: matrices twice + an
  extra SQLite connection) and accepts a warm `state`.
- BM25 scores via postings (only docs containing each term).
- Issue-mode lanes (BM25 + symbol grounding corpus) cached on `SearchState`
  for warm servers.
- `search_multi` queries repos concurrently; embedding cache writes are
  atomic (safe under concurrency).

## 0.3.2
- Legacy-PHP section chunker (banner sections, HTML islands, QMD cuts) with
  shape-routing: modern PSR/namespaced files keep the generic chunker.
- `chunks` CLI command, `megabrain_chunks` MCP tool, `GET /chunks` endpoint:
  every chunk of one file scored for a query, with selected flags.

## 0.3.1
- PHP `use`-statement import graph (PSR-4-agnostic FQCN index).
- Edge-preservation fix: re-indexing a file no longer destroys incoming edges
  indexed earlier in the same pass; GRAPH_EXTRAS retuned 6 → 7.
- Configurable index excludes: `--exclude` + `.megabrainignore`.

## 0.3.0
- PHP support; PyPI packaging; provider abstraction via OpenRouter
  (`MEGABRAIN_EMBED_MODEL` / `MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL` / local OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints).
