Point megabrain at a repo and ask **"how does auth work"** in plain English. It finds all
the related code in ~200 ms with **no LLM** — just math on embeddings, in **one SQLite
file**. No vector DB, no containers, no services.

Want it *explained*? `ask` adds one LLM call that narrates a walkthrough with the **real
code spliced in from disk**, line for line. The model only ever *points* at code — it
cannot rewrite a line, so nothing is invented.

## Quickstart

### Best quality — one key, nothing to configure

```bash
pip install megabrain
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...

megabrain index ~/repo                            # once — incremental after
megabrain ask   ~/repo "how does auth work end to end"
```

That single key gets you both halves of the validated stack, and they're already the
defaults:

- **`perplexity/pplx-embed-v1-0.6b`** for retrieval — the measured best for code recall.
  It beat pplx-4b, codestral-embed, openai-3-large and bge-m3 in a head-to-head bakeoff
  (R@1 **0.864**, bundle_full **0.955**).
- **`google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`** for narration — the fastest and cheapest tier,
  at the quality of models costing several times more. A full walkthrough in seconds, for
  fractions of a cent.

**Yes, 3.1 on purpose — `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` was measured and lost.** This model also
runs the rerank, where completeness is the whole point: 3.1 returned all three files a
real fix touched in 3 of 3 runs, 3.5 got two of three in 2 of 3. Narration was a tie, and
3.5 costs 67% more per output token. Recall traded away for a bigger bill is not an
upgrade. Every default here is a measurement, not a guess — including the ones that look
out of date. → [the numbers](docs/GUIDE.md#providers-and-models)

### No keys — your Claude plan + local embeddings

Narration runs on the Claude Code subscription you already pay for, embeddings run on your
machine, and **your code never leaves it**:

```bash
pip install 'megabrain[claude]'                   # narrates on your Claude Code login

unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY                           # ← or it bills the API, not your plan

ollama pull bge-m3                                # local embeddings, one time
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_MODEL=bge-m3

megabrain index ~/repo
megabrain ask   ~/repo "how does auth work end to end"
```

**That `unset` is the line people miss.** megabrain narrates through the Claude Agent SDK,
which drives the Claude Code CLI — and the CLI takes an API key over your login. With
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exported, every `ask` quietly bills the Anthropic API per token while
the subscription you already pay for sits unused. Nothing warns you; the answers are
identical. `unset` covers the current shell only, so if the key comes from your `~/.zshrc`
or `~/.bashrc`, drop it there too — or keep it and pick per-shell which one pays.

`bge-m3` is the local embedder to use. It matches the cloud one on the measure that
decides whether `ask` gets the right code at all, and trails it on ranking the single best
file first — a real trade, and a small one.

### Fully local — Ollama for both halves, zero cloud

Air-gapped, $0, open weights end to end:

```bash
pip install 'megabrain[languages]'
ollama pull bge-m3 && ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b

export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_MODEL=bge-m3
export MEGABRAIN_CHAT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL=qwen3-coder:30b

export MEGABRAIN_ASK_CTX_CHARS=105000     # ← required: see below
export OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=40960

megabrain index ~/repo --force            # --force re-embeds with the new model
megabrain ask   ~/repo "how does auth work end to end"
```

**Use a real coder model.** `qwen3-coder` is the one that holds up — the small dense models
are not a cheaper trade-off, they cite less *and* run slower, and a general-purpose model of
the same size does markedly worse on code.

**`MEGABRAIN_ASK_CTX_CHARS` is not optional.** `ask`'s budget is sized for cloud context
windows, so a local model silently gets a truncated prompt — no error, just quietly worse
answers. Compared to the cloud you lose some *secondary* citations, never correctness: the
code you're shown is still spliced verbatim from disk.

**[The numbers, and the extra knob thinking models need →](docs/RECIPES.md#run-fully-local--no-keys-no-cloud)**

Other languages need one extra install: `pip install 'megabrain[languages]'` adds
Ruby · Go · Rust · PHP. Python, JS/TS and Markdown work out of the box.
Every setup, with its cost: **[Guide](docs/GUIDE.md#1-install-and-your-first-answer)**.

---

## What you get

**Retrieval that cannot hallucinate.** The search path has no LLM at all — dense chunk
vectors fused with a file-skeleton signal and the import/call graph. The narrator only
ever *cites* spans and the engine splices the verbatim bytes, so no line is ever invented.
An optional [LLM rerank](docs/GUIDE.md#2-the-two-ways-to-ask) rides on top to drop
vocabulary-only matches — fail-open, never inside the core path.

**`ask` — the repo, explained.** One call returns a senior-engineer walkthrough of the
whole cross-file flow, with the real code spliced in at each step. Broad questions
[fan out into parallel sub-agents](docs/GUIDE.md#2-the-two-ways-to-ask), one per subsystem,
and a synthesizer merges their cited answers.

**It learns from itself.** Every `ask` caches its walkthrough. Ask again — even reworded —
and it serves in **~0 ms with zero LLM** (measured 27.8 s → 0.19 s), guarded by a
byte-level sha recheck so it can never describe code that changed.
[How it works →](docs/GUIDE.md#5-it-remembers--the-flow-cache)

**A knowledge graph, for free.** The same index doubles as a navigable map: communities,
the core "god node" files, and the real call-path between any two files — built from AST
edges plus embedding similarity, numpy only, no networkx.
[What it's actually good for →](docs/GUIDE.md#4-map-the-repo-with-the-graph)

**The answer is a MAP, not a wall of code.** `search` returns the files that answer the
task, each with its best-matching span (true line numbers) and the symbols it declares —
**~2 700 tokens against ~8 100 with bodies**, measured on a real bundle. The span already
says which lines to open, so the code is one `--full` away when you want it and never in
the way when you do not.

**A local studio.** `megabrain studio` opens the whole engine in your browser: search,
ask, the flow cache and the graph on a live canvas, plus a read-only code navigator
where every identifier is a go-to-definition link.
[Take the tour →](docs/GUIDE.md#3-the-studio)

**Everywhere you work.** A terminal CLI, an MCP server inside Claude Code / Codex / Cursor
/ Gemini CLI, a Python library, and the studio.

## For coding agents

This is what megabrain is *for*. Dropped into an unfamiliar repo, an agent burns 10–30
tool turns — grep, open a file, follow an import, grep again — before it writes a line,
and the picture it assembles is still its own guess.

```bash
megabrain install    # detects Claude Code · Codex · Cursor · Windsurf · Gemini CLI · Antigravity
```

|  | by hand | one megabrain call |
|---|---|---|
| tool turns | 10–30 | **1** |
| what lands in context | whole files, mostly irrelevant | **exactly the signal chunks** |
| the cross-file story | reconstructed, unverified | **narrated, real code spliced in** |
| asking it again later | the full re-exploration | **~0 ms, from the cache** |

Your agent gets **three** tools, and the smallness is the design — it already has Read,
Grep and an editor, so the surface carries only what megabrain alone can do:

| you want… | tool | what comes back |
|---|---|---|
| the **whole flow** behind a question, or behind a change you are about to make | **`megabrain_ask`** | a walkthrough with the real code spliced in at each step. The narrator **opens whatever the retrieved chunks left unexplained** and keeps reading until the answer is complete — so one call replaces a grep/Read chain |
| the **map**, or the **docs** | **`megabrain_search`** | the files that answer, each with its best span and the symbols it declares — no bodies (a third of the tokens); `content: "docs"` for prose, `bodies: true` for the code inline |
| to make a repo answerable | **`megabrain_index`** | the index, incremental by content hash |

Each tool's `inputSchema` is generated from `contracts/tools.py`, so a parameter cannot
exist on the wire without existing in the dispatch.

`ask` hands the model the best eight chunk bodies and a **map** of the rest, then serves
any file it asks for, verbatim from the index. Two things get added afterwards with no
model call: the definition of every helper the prose named, and **the tests that pin what
it described** — which is how a change stops breaking a test 1 600 lines away that nobody
looked at. Both were measured: three of four readers had been paying a second retrieval
call for the first, and the second caught a test that pinned the exact bug being fixed.

**It briefly had two more tools, `megabrain_code` and `megabrain_replace`, and they were
removed.** Measured across five tasks in three languages, what carried the value was the
narrator opening files until it had the whole flow — that now belongs to `ask`. The edit
machinery around it kept being discarded by the readers it was built for: a prepared edit
batch was wrong both times it was measured, and applying an edit is work the host's own
editor already does.

> **Put this in your agent's rules:** for any question about how the code works — and
> before any change — call `megabrain_ask` **first**, before grepping. One call returns the
> whole flow with the real code, and it goes and opens what retrieval missed.

## Measured, not vibes

Against [claude-context](https://github.com/zilliztech/claude-context) (Zilliz), the
closest open-source peer — same repo, same 22 hand-labelled questions, both at their best:

|  | megabrain | claude-context |
|---|---|---|
| **R@1** | **0.864** | 0.818 |
| **R@5** | **1.000** | 0.909 |
| search latency | **~22 ms** warm | ~1400 ms |
| vector store | **one SQLite file** | Milvus + etcd + MinIO |
| narrated answer | **yes** — real code spliced in | no (returns chunks) |

The golden set is ours, on a corpus megabrain was tuned against — treat the absolute
numbers as home-field and run it yourself.
