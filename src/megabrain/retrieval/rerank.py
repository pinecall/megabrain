"""LLM rerank over the pruned signal list — the `llm_prune` lane.

The deterministic prune is recall-safe by design: every bundle file contributes
its best chunk, so files that merely SHARE VOCABULARY with the query (tests,
eval scripts, A/B gates) survive as "signal" and bloat the output. Cosine can't
tell "implements scoring" from "tests scoring". This lane fixes exactly that:
a cheap LLM judges the candidates and returns only the relevant ids, ordered.
The engine then keeps/reorders its own verbatim chunks — the model selects, it
never writes code (same anti-hallucination stance as ask's citation splicing).

WHAT THE JUDGE SEES is lane-dependent, and it was measured, not assumed
(6 ground-truth queries x 4 views x 3 reps, nx/rails/megabrain indexes):

  view                        target kept   rank(med)   note
  1 query-aware line              18/18        2        never misses, judge is humble
  6-line window                   12/18        -        partial evidence invites
  full bodies, ONE call           15/18        1          confident WRONG exclusion
  full bodies, batches of 8       18/18        1        local competition per call

Partial evidence is worse than little evidence: on the cross-subsystem query
(rails#57197 — the answering file never mentions the state the question asks
about) every mid-size view dropped the answer 3/3, while the 1-line view and
the batched view kept it 3/3. Small candidate pools per call keep the judge
from over-confidently ruling files out; the price is a looser keep (median 7
vs 4 of ~29 survive) — and completeness beats ordering, so that trade is
taken. Hence:

  - remote HTTP lane (OpenRouter/compat): full bodies, batches of
    RERANK_BATCH chunks, parallel calls (~34K tokens ~ $0.009/rerank on
    flash-lite, +~300ms over the 1-line view)
  - local endpoint (Ollama serializes; big prompts choke it) and the claude
    CLI lane (~18s per spawned call): the 1-line query-aware view, one call

Fail-open everywhere, all-or-nothing across batches: no key, timeout, one
failed batch, malformed reply, unknown ids -> the deterministic result is
returned untouched. The LLM is an optimization, never a dependency.
