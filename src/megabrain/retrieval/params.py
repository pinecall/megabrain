"""RetrievalParams — every tuning knob of the retrieval pipeline, in ONE
frozen record, with its measurement provenance on the field.

These defaults ARE the validated configuration: each number was grid-tuned or
A/B-measured on the golden set (see field comments; history in CHANGELOG /
AGENTS.md). Changing any default is a RANKING-SHIFTING change — it needs a
golden-gate run by policy.

Injection replaces module-global mutation: sweeps (forge_eval grids, future
classifier evals) construct a variant with dataclasses.replace() and pass it
to load_state(root, params=...) instead of monkeypatching query.py globals.
The default path is byte-identical to the pre-params engine.
