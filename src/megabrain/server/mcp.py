"""Minimal MCP stdio server for megabrain (no external deps).

Tools (deliberately few — every tool costs the calling agent context and a
decision; the host already has Read/Grep for single files, so megabrain only
exposes what it alone can do):
  megabrain_ask(repo_path, question, scope_path?, docs?)
      -> explained answer, real code spliced (docs=true -> docs-only walkthrough)
  megabrain_search(repo_path, task, scope_path?, compact?, rerank?, docs?)
      -> flat relevance-ranked signal chunks with the real code, noise dropped
         (megabrain_query is a deprecated dispatch alias for it)
  megabrain_graph(repo_path, mode?, node?, source?, target?, scope_path?)
      -> the repo as a knowledge graph: communities map / one node / a path
  megabrain_index(repo_path)                  -> incremental index
  megabrain_forge(repo_path, ext?, list_only?, dry_run?, specialize?)
      -> COVERAGE: detect uncovered file types; LLM-generate + partition-validate
         + install a chunker per type (repo-local, trust-gated). specialize=true
         only lists poorly-chunked covered files (LLM specialization was removed;
         hand-write + gate via megabrain.forge.specialize.gate_strategy)
  megabrain_flows(repo_path, action?, n?)   -> manage the flow cache (on by default)
      -> action list|warm|refresh|enable|disable (warm pre-caches N workflows)

Run: python3 -m megabrain.mcp_server
Register (claude code):
  claude mcp add megabrain -- python3 -m megabrain.mcp_server

See README.md for how retrieval + the ask explanation work.

# Server-level instructions, returned by `initialize` and injected into the
# calling agent's context ONCE. This is the only megabrain text an agent is
# guaranteed to see: with tool search enabled (Claude Code's default) the tool
# SCHEMAS stay deferred and only names are visible until the agent searches for
# them — so what belongs here is the mental model and the routing between
# tools, not a restatement of each tool's own description.
#
# Every line below is a lesson from a real session, not documentation for its
# own sake; keep it that way, and keep it short — it costs context in every
# session that loads this server.
INSTRUCTIONS = """megabrain answers questions about a repo's CODE from a pre-built index, so you don't have to crawl files to understand it. Retrieval runs NO LLM: it ranks real chunks and returns verbatim code with true line numbers.

The implement/fix loop, ONE discovery call: megabrain_search returns the task's whole surface WITH bodies — the render IS your read; NEVER re-fetch a span it showed. megabrain_read only for spans rendered as POINTERS (omitted/set-aside/docs/tests), one batch (auto-splits). Then pinning tests FIRST -> ONE megabrain_replace built from the rendered code -> gates. No host Read/Edit, no grep.

Which tool:
- megabrain_map — FIRST call for any task: files ranked, spans, symbol outline, edges both ways, def sites, pinning tests. No bodies, judge-ranked.
- megabrain_read — batch fetch: ALL read targets in ONE call (path, path#symbol, path:start-end). Verbatim, true line numbers.
- megabrain_replace — batch exact-string edits in ONE call, transactional: validates every op first, any failure writes NOTHING. Existing files only (Write for new).
- megabrain_grep — exact identifier/string: matches grouped into DEFINES / READS (ranked by dependents, with who-reaches-it edges) / CONFIG / TESTS / DOCS. Zero LLM, ~50ms.
- megabrain_search — the task's whole surface WITH code bodies (`N→` gutter): ranked chunks + set-aside sites, doc sections, changelog, pinning tests. Replace directly from it; read only its pointers.
- megabrain_ask — the flow narrated across subsystems, code spliced in (broad questions fan out into sub-agents). Spliced CODE is verbatim; the PROSE is narration — verify its claims against that code.
- megabrain_graph — communities, core abstractions, how two areas connect.
- megabrain_index — register/refresh a repo (auto-refreshes when stale).
- megabrain_flows — cached ask walkthroughs.
- megabrain_forge — add a chunker for an uncovered file type.

TRUST the CODE, verify the PROSE: never grep or re-read what a render already showed. ONE scoped call, then work from it.

Two things that decide answer quality:
- scope_path EXCLUDES everything outside it from retrieval. Scope to a package root (e.g. activejob), never to its lib/ or src/ subfolder — that cuts away the package's tests, which are often the spec of the behavior you are asking about.
- On a bug, name the STATE to track, not just the symptom: "where along this path could scheduled_at be lost?" returns a trace; "why does the retry fire immediately?" invites a theory."""
