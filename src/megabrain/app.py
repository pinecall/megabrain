"""app — the application-service layer: one use-case per verb.

The three frontends (CLI, MCP, serve-api) used to each hand-roll the same
pre-steps: resolve a repo root from a possibly-sub-path, join a bare filename
onto a scope, normalize the agents tri-state, decide whether to auto-reindex.
That produced 4 copies of the rel-join fallback, 3 different agents parsings,
and an inconsistent reindex policy. Those pre-steps live HERE now; a frontend
maps its transport args to a use-case call and renders the result — nothing
more. Each use-case preserves the behavior of the strictest current caller;
where the frontends diverged, the docstring says which behavior won.
